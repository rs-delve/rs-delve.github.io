DELVE – Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics – is a multi-disciplinary group, convened by the Royal Society, to support a data-driven approach to learning from the different approaches countries are taking to managing the covid-19 pandemic. More information about the project and its work are available on the about and people pages.
 
Findings from the DELVE project will be posted on this site, with the aim of informing the development of strategic approaches to managing the covid-19 pandemic. These reports reflect understandings at the time of publication. As our scientific understanding of covid-19 and the pandemic develops, new insights will emerge of relevance to many of the reports posted on these pages.
 
Publications are posted to the reports page as they become available.
