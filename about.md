We are at a crucial juncture in the UK’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a pressing need to analyse emerging data from countries around the world to identify the most important factors that can help slow the spread of the virus and help find long-term solutions to the pandemic. Science has helped to guide the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and there is more the community can do to complement existing efforts. 

DELVE: Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics is a multi-disciplinary group, convened by the Royal Society, to support a data-driven approach to learning from the different approaches countries are taking to managing the pandemic. This effort has been discussed with and welcomed by Government, who have arranged for it to provide input through SAGE, its scientific advisory group for emergencies. 

DELVE will contribute data driven analysis to complement the evidence base informing the UK’s strategic response, by:

* Analysing national and international data to determine the effect of different measures and strategies on a range of public health, social and economic outcomes
* Using emerging sources of data as new evidence from the unfolding pandemic comes to light
* Ensuring that the work of this group is coordinated with others and communicated as necessary both nationally and internationally

This work will be carried out by three cross-disciplinary groups:

* Working group: a team of data scientists and subject-matter experts to carry out data analysis, synthesis of results and rapid review
* Advisory group: a wide group of experts to provide review and feedback
* Committee: a high-level expert group to oversee the work and communicate findings to the Government’s Chief Scientific Advisor and his networks in government
