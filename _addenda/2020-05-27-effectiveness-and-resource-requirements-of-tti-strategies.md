layout: addendum

abstract: >
    We use an individual-level transmission and contact simulation
    model to explore the effectiveness and resource requirements of
    various test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategies for reducing the
    spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, in the context of different
    scenarios with varying levels of stringency of non-pharmaceutical
    interventions (NPIs) over the summer period.
