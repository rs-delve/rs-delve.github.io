abstract: We use an individual-level transmission and contact simulation model to
  explore the effectiveness and resource requirements of various test-trace-isolate
  (TTI) strategies for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, in the context
  of different scenarios with varying levels of stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions
  (NPIs) over the summer period.
