## Summary

The DELVE masks report[^1] summarised the available evidence suggesting that universal use of masks by the public in situations where physical
distancing was not possible or predictable would decrease onward
transmission of SARS-CoV2 from asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected
individuals. Since this report was published, the UK government has
mandated mask use on public transport and in health care settings. The
British Medical Association has recommended the use of masks in these
settings.[^3] The WHO has also revised its guidelines along these
lines.[^4] Multiple countries, states and cities throughout the world
have mandated mask use in all settings where distancing is not possible
or predictable.[^5] The UK government has recommended but not mandated
mask use in these settings. This update presents important new evidence
that further supports the universal use of masks, including cloth masks
in all settings where distancing is not possible or predictable.
Universal mask use, including cloth masks, as a low cost way to
facilitate the opening up of society is strongly supported for two
reasons. First, prolonged contagiousness (median time 4 days)[^6] of
asymptomatic infected people means that there is a high potential for
disease transmission at a time when they are actively engaging with
others. Second, there is increasing empiric evidence that mask use
prevents SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The cumulative evidence, plus the
recent change in physical distancing policy, strongly supports the use
of masks in all circumstances where physical distancing of more than 1
meter cannot be maintained, and no physical barriers exist, including in
shops, office buildings and public settings.


*The original report was published on May 4, 2020.[^1] This paper has
drawn on evidence available up to 28 June 2020 and has not been subject
to formal peer-review. Further evidence on this topic is constantly
published and DELVE may return to this topic in the future. This
independent overview of the science has been provided in good faith by
subject experts. DELVE and the Royal Society accept no legal liability

# Key points

1. Longitudinal data support initial findings that the majority of
SARS-CoV2 infected individuals remain asymptomatic throughout
infection. Even individuals who become symptomatic can have a
several-day asymptomatic incubation period. Multiple new studies
suggest that transmission of SARS-CoV2 by asymptomatic individuals is
a substantial driver of transmission, including through droplets,
aerosols and super spreader events.

2. Evidence continues to accrue that masks, including cloth masks,
prevent onward transmission of infection. This is based on
observational and modeling data in humans, on the effectiveness of
masks in intercepting droplets and aerosols and on controlled studies
of experimental animals. Evidence is also accumulating that masks may
additionally protect the wearer.

3. There are no human controlled trials on the efficacy of universal
mask use in stemming SARS-CoV2 transmission. It is inherently
problematic to conduct such a trial on a practice that all must adhere
to for it to be efficacious. Nevertheless, the cumulative multifaceted
evidence on mask efficacy provides strong support for their use.
Several accepted medical and public health practices to reduce the
transmission of other infections are based on similar types of
evidence and not on the results of randomized clinical trials.

4. New evidence finds that the use of clear plastic face shields can
prevent onward transmission of droplets and aerosols. This addresses
concerns from individuals and communities who/that cannot use masks,
e.g., deaf people and individuals with breathing disorders,

5. While the UK government has mandated wearing of masks on public
transport and in healthcare settings, it has not mandated mask use in
other settings where the risk of transmission is high, such as in
shops and close-quarter workplaces. This is concerning at a time when
lockdown is being ended and the 2m distancing rule is being relaxed.
The accumulated evidence warrants urgent reconsideration of government
policy on masks. Mandatory use of masks or shields in all situations
outside the home where physical distancing is not possible will help
to counterbalance the expected increase in population-level exposure
as lockdown ends.

## Evidence Base

### Evidence of Asymptomatic Infection and Transmission

Transmission of Covid-19 from asymptomatic or presymptomatic people
allows community and institutional spread. These people, who are
contagious, feel well and therefore may expose others. Multiple studies
have shown that respiratory tract viral loads are highest for a few days
preceding symptom onset and a few days afterwards. New evidence from
epidemiological and modelling studies continues to lend strong support
for the role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission.
Concurrently, there are new rigorous longitudinal data showing that the
majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (up to \~ 90%) remain
asymptomatic throughout infection as well as multiple new studies that
add further support to asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 being a
substantial driver of transmission, including through aerosols and
superspreader events*.*[^6] [^7] [^7a] [^7b] [^7c] [^7d] [^7e] [^7f] [^7g]

A recent longitudinal study highlights the finding that most infected
individuals remain asymptomatic throughout the course of infection while
carrying the virus for several days in their respiratory mucosa without
ever manifesting symptoms.[^6] Investigation of the Covid-19 outbreak on
the Diamond Princess cruise ship by Japanese public health officials
resulted in the hospitalization of 96 asymptomatic infected people and
32 of their PCR-negative cabinmates, eight of whom later tested positive
(though two were lost to follow-up). The individuals were monitored
closely for symptoms, and they were re-tested by PCR between 5-7 days
after the first test, and then on every 2-3 days. From the 104
asymptomatic infected individuals who were followed, 11 (10.6%)
developed symptoms with a median asymptomatic incubation period of 4
days (interquartile range 3-5, range 3-7). The remaining 91 (89.4%)
cleared the virus as defined by two consecutive negative PCR tests while
remaining asymptomatic. 52% of them were still PCR-positive at 8 days
and 10% at 15 days. Thus, asymptomatic infected individuals can have
nasopharyngeal viral carriage for several days.

*The devastating effect of presymptomatic transmission is highlighted by
a report of a Covid-19 outbreak at a Seattle care home.*[^7] *A high
rate of presymptomatic disease in care home residents allowed spread of
infection to several facility wings. A total of 57 residents (64% of all
residents) and 26 staff (18% of all staff) were infected. Infected staff
included nurses, as well as physical therapists, food delivery staff and
janitorial staff, many of whom worked in multiple facility wings. Eleven
of the infected residents were hospitalised and 15 died. The lack of
recognition of presymptomatic spread of infection, and the assumption
that asymptomatic persons were not contagious, was the main factor that
was linked to spread of infection in the facility.*

### New studies providing support for efficacy of masks in preventing onward transmission of SARS-CoV2

#### Observational Studies

-   A retrospective cohort study of households carried out over a 4 week
    period from 28 February to 27 March, 2020 in Beijing, China supports
    the efficacy of face masks (unstated type) in prevention of
    SARS-CoV2 transmission from asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals
    in indoor settings.[^10] The secondary attack rate in families was
    23.0% (77/335). Face mask use by the primary case and family
    contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79%
    effective in reducing transmission in comparison to controls. In a
    multivariable regression logistic model four factors were
    significantly associated with household transmission: diarrhea in
    the index case (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.6); close contact within
    1 meter to the index case for 1-3 close contacts (3.3, 1.05 to
    10.40) and for ≥ 4 contacts (18.26, 3.93 to 84.79); ≥ 1 family
    member wearing a mask at home before disease onset in index case
    (0.21, 0.06 to 0.79); and surface disinfection ≥ 1 times/day (0.23,
    0.07 to 0.84).

-   A recent study from Hong Kong supports the role of masks in
    preventing indoor transmission. All 14 of the case clusters
    occurring over the first 100 days of the pandemic occurred in
    indoor settings.[^11] Eleven of these clusters, that involved 113
    cases, occurred in recreational mask-off settings (bars,
    restaurants, gyms) whereas there were only 3 clusters involving
    only 11 cases in workplace “mask on” settings (p = 0.04). The
    authors also surveyed mask-wearing compliance of 10,050
    pedestrians in early April and found that 97% of them were wearing
    masks. They make the argument that one of the reasons for almost
    complete control of the epidemic in Hong Kong is because of
    universal mask wearing. The city is very densely populated, yet
    despite this has had an early and sustained control over
    transmission with only 148 cases total per million population and
    \< 25 cases/day for the last several weeks.[^12]

-   Mitze and colleagues used the early adoption of a universal public
    mask requirement in Jena, Germany to estimate mask effectiveness in
    abrogating transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[^13] They compared the
    Covid-19 incidence in Jena to other German cities and regions,
    controlling for other mitigation and host risk factors, using a
    “synthetic control” method in a carefully performed study of a
    natural experiment. They estimated that the mask wearing policy
    resulted in a 40 to 60% decrease in the daily growth rate of the
    epidemic. The estimated effect of a universal mask wearing policy
    was larger for larger cities than for the entire region studied. A
    limitation of the study is the lack of uncertainty for their
    estimates. Of note, this study shows the effect of a compulsory mask
    policy and not mask wearing per se, since no data are presented on
    compliance with the policy or the type of mask worn. The German mask
    policy did not specify the type of mask to be used. It stipulated
    that the mask/face covering used had to cover the mouth and nose.

#### Modeling Studies

-   Stutt and colleagues model the effectiveness of masks in preventing
    transmission of Covid-19, with assumptions of variable mask
    effectiveness, mask wearing compliance and varying importance of
    non-airborne infection.[^14] They conclude that disease transmission
    can be markedly decreased over a plausible range of mask
    effectiveness with widespread use of masks by the public. A
    limitation of this study is that it is strictly theoretical and
    therefore the conclusions depend on the base assumptions of mask
    effectiveness and constant mask use at all times when proximate to
    another person for optimal effectiveness.

-   Ngonghala and colleagues[^15] and Eikenberry and colleagues,[^16]
    modeled the impact of mask wearing on epidemic growth of Covid-19,
    as well as hospitalizations and mortality. These two studies are
    mainly from one academic department and use assumed values of mask
    effectiveness and compliance. The data are useful to visualize the
    relative impacts of mask effectiveness and mask wearing compliance
    on disease transmission and outcomes. They provide support for
    widespread mask wearing even if the estimated effect sizes may not
    be accurate. Apart from the limitation of this being a purely
    modeling study with assumed parameters that may or may not be
    correct, it does not factor in the possibility of disease
    transmission by direct inoculation of mucosal surfaces with
    virus-containing respiratory secretions.

-   Zhang and colleagues estimated that public wearing of masks resulted
    in tens of thousands fewer cases of Covid-19 infection in New York
    City and elsewhere.[^17] They also specify that disease transmission
    is mostly via aerosols. However, the conclusions of this study are
    not supported by the presented evidence, as summarized by a number
    of scientists requesting a retraction by the authors.[^18]

#### New observation study providing support for efficacy of masks in protecting the wearer from SARS-CoV2

-  A Covid-19 outbreak occurred on the United States Naval aircraft carrier, the USS Roosevelt.[^19] Approximately 25% of its 4200-member crew were affected over the course of a three-month voyage from January to April 2020. Respiratory illnesses can spread easily on naval ships because of tight living quarters and close contact between crew members.[^20] Of 382 crew members surveyed, 60% had evidence for Covid-19 infection. A face covering was worn by 81% of those not developing infection, and 56% of those who became infected. Thus, use of a face covering was significantly associated with a decreased risk of becoming infected (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.5). This study suggests that face coverings can also provide protection to the wearer.

### Surgical and cloth masks reduce onward transmission of small particle aerosols of infectious agents

***Several clinical and laboratory studies demonstrate that surgical and
cloth masks can effectively reduce the transmission of small particle
aerosols of infectious agents.*** Since aerosol particles are smaller
than airborne droplets, this substantiates the effectiveness of surgical
and cloth masks for source control of droplets.

-   *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the bacterium causing tuberculosis, is
    a prime example of an infection spread predominantly by the aerosol
    route from the cough of TB patients. Dharmadhikari et al. showed
    that wearing a surgical mask by patients with pulmonary TB reduced
    aerosol transmission to guinea pigs placed in the room exhaust air.
    69 of 90 (77%) guinea pigs exposed to air from unmasked patients
    developed TB versus 36 of 90 (40%) animals exposed to air from
    masked patients, a 52% reduction (95% CI 40 - 63%).[^21] Cough is a
    prominent feature of lung TB and guinea pigs are exquisitely
    sensitive to TB. Thus, surgical masks were efficacious in preventing
    airborne transmission not only from breathing and talking, but also
    from coughing. Indeed, TB patients are routinely asked to wear
    surgical masks (rather than N95 masks) to prevent onward
    transmission.[^22]

-   *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a bacterium that colonizes and causes
    pathology in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and can be spread
    by aerosols. Two studies show the efficacy of surgical masks in
    preventing transmission of *P. aeruginosa* aerosols.[^23] [^24] In
    the first study, wearing surgical masks and covering the mouth when
    coughing reduced the production of *P. aeruginosa* aerosols by 90%
    in patients with cystic fibrosis during coughing and by 95% during
    talking when sampled at a 2m distance.[^23] In this study, 71 to 86%
    of captured aerosol *P. aeruginosa* particles from subjects not
    wearing masks while coughing were \<4.7 um in diameter. The second
    study also showed that surgical masks reduced aerosol (\<4.7 um)
    transmission of *P. aeruginosa* from coughing CF patients by 86% in
    comparison to no masks.[^24]

-   A series of controlled experiments in a hamster SARS-CoV2
    transmission model provides a strong case for the use of surgical
    masks in reducing transmission, particularly for source protection
    from the infected case.[^27] Infected (“index”) hamsters were
    co-housed separated by barriers such that they shared the same
    closed airspace, but no physical contact was possible. In two of the
    three groups the barriers were covered with standard surgical mask
    material such that the fluid repellant exterior mask surface was
    facing either the uninfected animals (simulating protection from
    onward transmission) or the index hamster (simulating masking the
    infected subject). Non-contact transmission was observed in 10 of 15
    (67%) of the unprotected animals, 2 of 12 (16.7%) animals when the
    index animal was “masked”, and 4 of 12 animals where the naïve
    animals were “masked”. The odds ratios of infection compared to
    unmasked controls were 0.1 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.64) and 0.25 (0.05 to
    1.2) for “masking” of the infected animal and “masking” of the
    uninfected animals, respectively. This represents a 75% reduction in
    transmission when the infected animal was “masked”, and a 50%
    reduction when the uninfected animals were “masked”. Neither of the
    masked groups mounted a Covid-19 antibody response whereas all of
    the index hamsters and 60% of the unmasked exposed hamsters did, and
    regardless of mask orientation all mask protected animals were
    significantly less ill than non-mask-protected animals.

Thus, surgical masks can prevent transmission of two bacterial lung
infections known to be transmitted by aerosol, by intercepting the
aerosolized bacteria even from coughing patients. An animal model study
suggests the same is true for SARS-Cov2. Therefore, for those SARS-CoV2
transmission events that are aerosol-transmitted masks could provide
excellent source control.

### Cloth masks can prevent transmission of aerosols and droplets

The worldwide push to use nonmedical cloth masks led us to review a new
study on this topic, and importantly to revisit studies on the efficacy
of surgical masks from a time when they were made of cloth and reused.

-   An in-silico study that modeled the utility of cloth facemasks
    concluded that cloth masks should provide excellent source
    protection from coughing or sneezing, where they would greatly
    reduce the turbulent flow that can otherwise send small droplets for
    distances of 7-8 meters.[^28] They predicted two different effects
    depending on droplet size, completely stopping (absorbing) those 4
    um or greater, while reducing the velocity of the air carrying the
    smaller ones. Their modeling results are in general agreement with
    experimental studies cited in the main report.

-   Two older studies suggest the efficacy of cloth “surgical” masks for
    source protection.[^29] [^30] Until at least the mid-1970’s surgical
    masks were made of cloth, usually cotton, layers. Both show that
    these reusable cloth masks were 90 to 95% efficient at filtering
    outward oral-origin aerobic bacterial particles in the 1-10 um
    diameter range.

-   An important paper from 1978 examined the efficacies of different
    weaves of cotton as well as the incorporation of a non-woven fabric
    layer in protection against aerosols.[^31] Using an aerosol of a
    bacterial suspension in saline, cotton materials had filtration
    efficacies of 43-94% depending on the weave. The filtration
    efficacies were 43% for bleached cotton (thread 40x46), 69% for
    bleached cotton with an increased thread (46 X50), 73% for Calico
    (thread 80 X 80) and 94% for Twill weave cotton. Fine glass fiber
    with nonwoven fabric had 98% - 99% effectiveness. A noteworthy
    aspect of this paper is that in 1978, there already existed a
    standard commercial machine for testing materials with aerosols.

-   A study of tightly fitting cloth masks or respirators examined the
    protection of experimental animals from aerosolized *Mycobacterium
    tuberculosis*. Cloth masks (6 layers, 44 thread/inch) performed
    almost as well as the respirators, preventing 77% of infections
    versus 97% for the respirators.[^32] While this was not a study of
    source control, but rather of wearer protection, it demonstrates
    that cloth masks can prevent the entry of particles that are smaller
    than the holes between the mask fibers, likely because of
    overlapping layers that produce an irregular path for particles. It
    demonstrates that mask protection is dependent not only on the
    fabric type but also on its fit, and that multiple cloth layers can
    be very effective at filtering small (\< 5 um diameter) particles.

### Characteristics of cloth masks

As mask use is becoming widespread, it is important to identify
materials that will prevent droplet transmission and yet be comfortable
to wear. Cloth masks can be made that have high filtration efficiency,
but as this increases the resistance to airflow through the mask also
increases. A metric taking both factors into account is termed the
filter quality factor (Q factor), and is used as a single measure of
wearability and protection, based on U.S. National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health standard tests for masks.[^33] The
challenge for cloth mask manufacture is to optimize the Q factor, and
the fit of the mask. Several modifications of cloth masks can increase
filtration without excessively increasing flow resistance. These
modifications include the use of an electrostatically charged
fabric,[^33] layering of materials and use of different materials in the
mask[^35] [^36] and increasing fabric hydrophobicity.[^37]

Since all of these in vitro studies assume 100% fit, which is not the
case for all but properly fitted respirators such as the FFP2 or N95
masks, the actual filtration effectiveness is only a rough guide to the
use of these fabrics in mask construction.[^38] Facial fit, including
the use of nose clip, is likely as or more important than the fabric
used in the mask. Of vital importance is that prevention of transmission
from an infected source will not be reliable if exhaust valves are built
into a mask. Because cloth mask demand will increase with a requirement
for their wear on public transport and for hospital visitors,
consideration should be given to establishing basic manufacturing
standards and testing guidelines. The Association Française de
Normalisation (AFNOR) has established standards and guidelines for such
masks, which they term barrier masks.[^39] [^40] The AFNOR standards
prohibit both intake and exhaust valves. Of note, the AFNOR standards
concern primarily wearer protection as opposed to prevention of source
transmission, so any new UK standards will have to consider the
prevention of source transmission as well. Standards like this will help
the UK fabric industry meet demand to make optimally performing cloth
masks. At least one UK manufacturer has already begun this process.[^41]

### Studies of air flow patterns around masks

-   Dbouk and Drikakis report the theoretical distribution of
    respiratory droplets produced by coughing and their interruption by
    wearing a theoretical mask.[^42] [^43] These papers provide a
    theoretical framework for mask effectiveness and droplet spread,
    show that leaks around the mask need to be considered, and that a
    mask reduces the velocity of forward spread.

-   Tang and colleagues demonstrated qualitatively the ability of a
    surgical mask to interrupt turbulent air resulting from a cough as
    well as leakage around the mask, providing supporting evidence for
    the Dbouk and Drikakis studies.[^44]

-   Viola and colleagues provide qualitative and quantitative data on
    the ability of N95, surgical and cloth face masks, and face shields,
    to block forward transmission during coughing and breathing,
    amplifying on the Tang study.[^45] They found that 90% of forward
    transmission was blocked by all mask types, including the homemade
    cloth masks. Depending on the gap between the covering and the face
    there was downward, lateral, upward and backward leakage.

### Face shields for individuals unable to wear masks

Face masks present problems for certain individuals, e.g. people with
chronic respiratory conditions like asthma and deaf people who rely on
lip reading.[^12] [^47] Clear plastic face shields could circumvent the
difficulties with mask use in these populations. Studies on face shields
are more limited and address protection to the recipient rather than
their ability to prevent onward transmission.[^48] One recent study
measured air (with an optical technique), coming from breathing and
coughs found shields highly effective (more than masks) at stopping
direct frontward emission, although most of the air was sent downward,
and smaller amounts to the sides and upward.[^38] Therefore, shields
would be unsuitable to prevent transmission to people lower than the
wearer, e.g. sitting on a bus next to a standing wearer or lying down in
care-settings. For two standing people of similar height facing one
another, protection would be very good, but aerosols would still get
dispersed in an enclosed space. However, leakage jets were also seen
with masks, including downward and to the back and sides.

**Definition of Terms**

*Airborne transmission* Transmission of an infectious agent through the
air, from an infected source to an uninfected person. This includes both
droplet and aerosol transmission.

*Aerosol route of infection* Airborne transmission of small particles
(generally ≤ 5 um diameter) that can enter the lung alveoli directly
during inhalation, and can persist suspended in the air for hours.
Examples of infections that are transmitted by aerosols include measles
and tuberculosis.

*Droplet route of infection* Airborne transmission of large particles
(generally ≥ 10 um diameter) that because of their size cannot easily
enter the lung alveoli. These particles fall to the ground within
minutes, traveling short distances (usually 1 to 2 meters) before
falling. They cause infection by deposition in the nose, mouth or eye.
The primary infection is therefore of the eye (conjunctivitis), the
upper respiratory tract (rhinitis, pharyngitis) or both sites. Those
infectious agents that spread by the droplet route and cause pneumonia
do so in a sequential fashion with the initial infection being in the
upper respiratory tract and a secondary infection in the lung.
Coronavirus infections are transmitted primarily by the droplet route.

*Super spreader event* Transmission of airborne infection from a single
person to a large number of people at one time and place.

*Mask* A protective covering of the mouth and nose. Surgical and medical
masks are made of synthetic fabrics, and are usually fluid repellant at
the outer face. Masks are distinguished from respirators in that the
former are relatively loosely fitting and the latter form a tight seal
around the face or head. Examples of respirators are the N95, FFP2 and
powered air purifying respirator (PAPR). Cloth masks are a type of mask
and can be used for similar purposes, depending on design.

*Cloth face covering* A type of mask made from cloth materials of one to
several layers, varying in design and fit. An alternative term used to
distinguish these masks from certified medical or surgical masks.

*Onward transmission* Transmission of an infectious agent from an
infected person to an uninfected person. (Onward transmission and Source
control are converse terms.)

*Source control* Prevention or reduction of transmission of infectious
agent from an infected person to an uninfected person. (Source control
and Onward transmission are converse terms). See Figure.

*Wearer protection* Prevention or reduction of deposition of infectious
droplets into the mouth or nose of, or inhalation of infectious aerosols
by, the wearer of a mask or cloth face covering. See Figure 1.
