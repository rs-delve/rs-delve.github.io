| **Germany**     | The federal government provides national recommendations, but the responsibility lies with the 16 states.                                    | All schools and early care centres.    | All schools were open by 6th May 2020 after 7 weeks of closures.                                                                                                                                                                                      | No. Schools will be back to normal from August 2020.                                                                                    | No, local level closures will be implemented if there is a surge in cases. |
| **Italy**       | National guidance to be released on 25th June. However, schools have the autonomy to decide how to manage NPIs.                              | All schools and early care centres.    | They are not open. They have been closed since 4th March 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                        | No. Schools will open in September 2020                                                                                                 | Not known.                                                                 |
| **France**      | Central government provided guidelines with flexibility left to local authorities.                                                           | All schools and early care centres.    | Phased opening from May 8th after nation-wide closures from 16th March.                                                                                                                                                                               | Yes, since 22nd June except for lycées.

<li>
<p>Although some states closed schools from February, on a national level schools were closed on 16th March 2020. There were 1,214 active COVID-19 cases and 13 deaths in the country when this decision was made. The children of essential workers were able to attend throughout the closures.</p>

</ul></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>School opening macro policies</td>
<td><ul>
<li>
<p>The federal government announced on 20th April that states should reopen schools using a staggered approach by May 6th 2020 – 7 weeks after closing – allowing for physical distancing measures to be implemented. This announcement was made when there were 1,323 active cases of COVID-19 in the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, there was no federal or regional approach to school openings. A decentralised and inconsistent approach was implemented across the country. For example, from 24th April, some state schools reopened to students in the final two years of school e.g. in North Rhine-Westphalia, a state that had one of the highest rates of Covid-19 cases in the country, while others only used online learning tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the majority of schools are now open, classes are not yet operating at full capacity in most states. There are some exceptions, e.g. in the state of Hessen, all primary schools are operating at full capacity with no distancing measures in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attendance is not currently mandatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education ministers published a strategy paper on the 28th of March recommending that schools open for all students after the summer holidays, i.e. in August with blended learning measures in place. Initial plans to continue implementing physical distancing measures after the summer break has since been abandoned by most states to allow schools to operate at full capacity, following advice from the Conference of Education Ministers (KMK) in June. This was announced when there were approximately 7,300 active cases, 534 new cases and 14 daily deaths across the country.</p>
</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>School opening micro policies</td>
<td><ul>
<li>
<p>Although the majority of schools are now open, classes are typically divided into smaller groups to allow for distancing measures to continue. The majority of students are still learning through online-distancing tools. However, schools in some states, e.g.in Hessen have opened all primary schools at full capacity with no distancing measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RKI – the official public health body- and later the government provided non-statutory guidance on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) for schools to prevent the further spread of Covid-19 as detailed in Table 2.</p>
</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Facilitators</td>

<li>
<p>Large-scale community testing has made it easy for Germany to track the source of outbreaks. This has enabled local school closures where necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Challenges</td>
<td><ul>
<li>
<p>A decentralised approach to school openings has made it difficult to keep track of useful interventions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There have been a number of changes to national guidance and state approach which has been confusing for schools and families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once schools open at full capacity in August, a typically large number of children in classrooms – up to 32 – will increase the likelihood of transmission</p>
</li>
</ul></td>

<td>Outcomes to date</td>
<td><ul>
<li>
<p>In May, the reproduction rate (Ro) rose above 1 once schools and other sectors reopened. This was not attributed to school settings and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Localised closures are being implemented at varying levels in accordance with the number infections, e.g. in mid-to-late June:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>City-wide school closures:</strong> Schools and daycare centres in the German district of Gütersloh closed after an outbreak of 400-657 cases at a local meat factory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neighbourhood closures:</strong> Several schools in Madeburg, Saxony-Anhalt were closed after an accumulation of ~60 new cases in a few days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Individual school closures:</strong> In Wuppertal, North Rhine-Westphalia, a primary school was forced to close after new infections were detected</p>

<p>Two weeks after schools – and other sectors - opened, the Danish authorities previously reported an increase in the reproduction (R) rate of Covid-19, from 0.6 to 0.9 per cent. However, there were no signs that the partial reopening of schools had caused a bigger spread of infection.” Importantly, R had fallen to 0.7 in the first week of May according to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI)</p>

<li>
<p>On June 24th, nine weeks after schools opened the active number of cases has continued to fall, indicating that schools opening may not be contributing to major transmissions in cases</p>

<p>In June, an “outbreak” resulted in infections in 34 persons in the town of Hjørring. Pupils and teachers from a few classes in two schools were sent into isolation. There was no widespread school closures. Other than that, schools have not been associated with an increased transmission of the virus.</p>

This includes more than 100 cases from a single school in Jerusalem; which may have been a low probability “super spreading event”. In mid-June, at least 300 students and teachers had tested positive for COVID-19 and more than 100 schools had been shut.</p></li>

<td><p>A study of the transmission of coronavirus in both primary and secondary schools, conducted by Australia’s National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance found that there was “very limited” spread in schools. The study, from March to mid-April, looked at transmission rates from nine students and nine staff members who tested positive for Covid-19 from 15 different schools. Despite 735 students and 128 staff coming into close contacts with these initial 18 cases, only two people were found to have contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Individual school closures: To date, there have been few outbreaks in schools, e.g. two colleges in Sydney were closed at the end of May 2020 after one student in each school tested positive for COVID-19 and a primary school in Melbourne was closed in mid-June after two pupils also tested positive. There have been no reports of multiple secondary transmissions in schools.</p></td>
