## Introduction

tti-explorer is a library for simulating infection spread. This library is built to explore the impact of various test-trace-isolate strategies and social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in the UK.

Our model builds upon the model of Kucharski et al. (2020). We use the BBC Pandemic dataset (Klepac et al. (2018)).

This work was conducted for the Test, Trace, Isolate project as part of the Royal Society's DELVE initiative. This repository facilitiates simulations for a technical report which can be found here. These simulations inform the report for the Test, Trace, Isolate project which can be found here. Exact version of this repo used in the report is available as a tag.

For an introduction to the functionality offered by TTI-explorer, start with the (TTI-experiment notebook)[https://colab.research.google.com/github/rs-delve/tti-explorer/blob/master/notebooks/tti-experiment.ipynb].

## Further information

More information about the functionality of tti-explorer can be found in the [technical document](/pdfs/2020-05-27-effectiveness-and-resource-requirements-of-tti-strategies.pdf) as well as in the full [DELVE report on TTI](/reports/2020/05/27/test-trace-isolate.html).
