## Introduction

TTI-explorer is a library for simulating infection spread. This library is built to explore the impact of various test-trace-isolate strategies and social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in the UK.

Our model builds upon the model of Kucharski et al. (2020). We use the BBC Pandemic dataset (Klepac et al. (2018)).

For an introduction to the functionality offered by TTI-explorer, start with the [TTI-experiment notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rs-delve/tti-explorer/blob/master/notebooks/tti-experiment.ipynb).

## Further information

More information about the functionality of TTI-explorer can be found in the [technical document](/pdfs/2020-05-27-effectiveness-and-resource-requirements-of-tti-strategies.pdf) as well as in the full [DELVE report on TTI](/reports/2020/05/27/test-trace-isolate.html).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community in the form of issues and pull requests on our [Github repository](https://github.com/rs-delve/tti-explorer).
