layout: report
abstract: 'Face masks could offer an important tool for contributing to the management
  of community transmission of Covid19 within the general population. Evidence supporting
  their potential effectiveness comes from analysis of: (1) the incidence of asymptomatic
  and pre-symptomatic transmission; (2) the role of respiratory droplets in transmission,
  which can travel as far as 1-2 meters; and (3) studies of the use of homemade and
  surgical masks to reduce droplet spread. Our analysis suggests that their use could
  reduce onward transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic wearers if widely
  used in situations where physical distancing is not possible or predictable, contrasting
  to the standard use of masks for the protection of wearers. If correctly used on
  this basis, face masks, including homemade cloth masks, can contribute to reducing
  viral transmission.

## Summary

{{ page.abstract | markdownify }}

### Key points

1.  **Asymptomatic (including presymptomatic) infected individuals are
    infectious.** Without mitigation, the current estimate is that
    40%-80% of infections occur from individuals without symptoms[^1]
    [^2] [^3] [^4]. Universal screening of asymptomatic SARS-COV2 in
    women admitted for delivery in New York City shows that 13.7% were
    infected, and that asymptomatic women accounted for 88% of infected
    individuals in the study[^5]. Of individuals who do become
    symptomatic, viral loads are the highest in the presymptomatic and
    early symptomatic phase, decreasing thereafter[^6] [^7] [^8] [^9]
    [^10] [^11] [^12].

2.  **Respiratory droplets from infected individuals are a major mode of
    transmission**[^13]. This understanding is the basis of the
    recommendations for physical distancing, and of the PPE guidance for
    healthcare workers[^14]. Droplets do not only come from coughing or
    sneezing: in a-/pre-symptomatic individuals, droplets are generated
    via talking and breathing[^15].

3.  **Face masks reduce droplet dispersal.** Cloth-based face masks
    reduce emission of particles by variable amounts, for example
    Anfinrud *et al*[^15] showed that they are almost completely
    eliminated. Davies *et al*[^17] showed that cloth masks filtered
    viral particles during coughing at about 50 to 100% of the
    filtration efficiency of surgical masks, depending on fabric, with
    absolute filtration efficiencies of 50-70%, and about 70-80% for
    oral bacteria. van der Sande *et al*[^18] showed 50% filtering
    efficiency for airborne particles.

**This evidence supports the conclusion that more widespread risk-based
face mask adoption can help to control the Covid-19 epidemic by reducing
the shedding of droplets into the environment from asymptomatic
individuals**. This is also consistent with the experiences of countries
that have adopted this strategy.

Our analysis focuses on the effect of face masks on onward virus
transmission, or source control[^19], of infected but symptom-free
wearers. This is to be distinguished from the use of face masks as
*personal* protection against virus acquisition. We have found only two
randomised control trials in the primary literature on the use of face
masks to reduce onward transmission; one[^20] was underpowered, and the
other[^21] showed significant reduction when adjusted for actual mask
usage in a posthoc analysis. One non-randomized study showed that mask
use to prevent onward transmission significantly reduced viral
respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised patients.[^22]
Greenhalgh *et al*[^23] and Javid *et al*[^24] argue that “absence of
evidence” should not be misinterpreted as “evidence of absence”, and in
support of face mask usage by the public based on the precautionary
principle.

### Policy implications

-   Strategies to transition out of lockdown need to take into account
    the role of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in
    spreading Covid-19. Face masks can reduce viral shedding into the
    environment from such individuals. Both commercially available and
    homemade cloth masks and surgical masks can play a role.

-   Face masks may play an important role in situations where social
    distancing is not possible or unpredictable. These situations
    include public transport, stores and shopping areas, work places,
    within households, clinics, hospitals, care-homes, social care, and
    busy pavements. If used widely and correctly and on a risk basis,
    face masks, including homemade cloth masks, can reduce viral
    transmission: benefits of use increase where risk exposure is high
    and are marginal where its low.

-   Public health interventions that involve cost to the public and
    access to reliable information tend to be taken up faster, more
    widely or more effectively by higher socio-economic status groups.
    If the use of cloth face masks in public is made mandatory or highly
    recommended, interventions may be necessary to ensure that all
    members of the public have access to these masks and information
    about proper use, including guidance on washing and re-use
    appropriate to the domestic environment to ensure that masks
    themselves do not become fomites..

-   While there is anecdotal evidence of individual risk compensation
    behaviour, at a population level the introduction of safety measures
    like HIV prevention measures, seatbelts and helmets have led to
    increased safety and even increased safety oriented behaviour[^25].
    There is no evidence for individual risk compensation amongst the
    public during epidemics.

-   Clear instructions, that they should be worn in addition to other
    government measures like physical distancing and handwashing, and
    that they primarily protect others rather than the wearer, will be
    necessary to support correct use and avoid risk compensation
    behaviour. The establishment of standards for manufactured and
    homemade cloth face masks, as has been done for other areas of
    public health, is one approach to achieving this.

-   In parallel with any policy recommending the use of cloth face masks
    for the general public, it will be necessary to take all steps to
    ensure sufficient supply of surgical masks as well as PPE for
    frontline NHS and social care workers. Use of cloth face masks by
    the public must not compete with or compromise the supply of PPE for
    clinical use.

This summary represents the main conclusion of the DELVE Initiative on
the wearing of face masks in public, based on a review of the primary
literature, and new data-enabled analyses. This evidence base supports
the conclusion that appropriate use of surgical and cloth, including
homemade, face masks among the public can have a mitigating effect on
the spread of Covid-19.

Technical annexes to this document provide detailed analyses, review
additional considerations, and highlight particular practical issues of
importance.

### Areas where further investigation is needed

-   While there is good indirect supporting evidence that suggests
    droplets are a main transmission route, the relative contribution of
    droplet transmission has not yet been directly established
    empirically.

-   Evidence on the extent of transmission from those who remain
    asymptomatic as opposed to pre-symptomatic transmissions is
    evolving. Further work on population testing and transmission
    studies is needed to address these gaps.

-   Since risk exposure varies (from 0 to 1), it follows that advice on
    mask wearing is most useful if it is risk based. Further work is
    recommended to evaluate & categorise risk exposure, in order to give
    the public practical advice on when mask use is most and least
    necessary. Until such studies are definitive, it may be useful to
    consider whether simple common-sense guidelines could be a
    constructive interim measure where it is likely that physical
    distancing may be difficult or unpredictable.

-   Mask efficacy depends on material, fit, and other factors. It
    follows that guidance on risk exposure would be useful (when is a
    cloth mask adequate, what activity would merit a well-fitted
    higher-grade mask?).

## Evidence Base

### Current understanding of transmission mechanism and public mask wearing

#### What proportion of transmissions are asymptomatic/presymptomatic?

There is evidence of transmissions from both infected asymptomatic
individuals, as well as from presymptomatic individuals, i.e.,
infectious individuals who will go on to display symptoms but are
asymptomatic at the time of transmission[^26] [^27]. Mechanistically,
this is related to the high viral load typical of SARS-CoV-2 at the time
of symptom onset, as well as evidence of viral shedding occurring prior
to the appearance of symptoms[^28] [^29]. One recent paper estimated
contributions to the overall reproduction number $R_0$ arising from
asymptomatic ($R_a$), presymptomatic ($R_p$), symptomatic ($R_s$), and
environmental transmission ($R_e$), i.e. $R_0=R_a+R_p+R_s+R_e$, and found ratios
of $R_a$:$R_p$:$R_s$:$R_e$ = 1:9:8:2[^2]. Note that in this paper, environmental
transmission is defined as transmission via contamination; in other
words in a way that would not be attributable to contact with the
infected source[^2]. This is broadly consistent with estimates of
46%-55% presymptomatic transmission in He *et al*[^32] as well as
estimates of 48% and 62% in data from Singapore and Tianjin[^33]. We
note that one report estimated that prior to the implementation of
travel restrictions on January 23, 2020, in China, up to 79% of
documented cases arose from undocumented infections, many of whom were
likely not severely symptomatic[^34].

#### What proportion of transmissions are from droplets vs aerosols?

It is currently believed that droplets are the main route of
transmission. Whilst there is indirect evidence that supports this, the
relative contribution of droplet/aerosol transmission has not been
estimated.

Aerosols refer to suspensions in gas of small particles (typically \<
5-10 µm) and can travel relatively long distances. Droplets refer to
large particles (\> 20 µm) and can only travel short distances as they
will fall to ground due to gravity[^35]. While the possibility of
aerosol transmission of COVID-19 has been clearly demonstrated through
experiments[^36] and outbreak reports (e.g., Washington state
choir[^37]), it remains unclear what proportion of infection can be
attributed to aerosol transmission. Some studies provide indirect
evidence that droplets may be the main routes of transmission. For
example, a recent report by Lu *et al*[^38] describes an outbreak in a
restaurant in Guanzhou, China, in which customers were likely to have
been infected through droplets that travelled through air conditioning
airflow; they conclude that the patterns of outbreak is consistent with
droplet transmission, rather than aerosol transmission. Anfinrud *et
al*[^15] demonstrates that droplets, smaller than those generated
through coughing or sneezing, can be generated via speech, providing
further evidence that droplet transmission may play important roles.
Public Health England[^40] also suggests that droplets and contacts are
main routes of transmission. It is currently unknown what proportion of
infected cases can be attributed to aerosol vs droplet transmission.

#### What proportion of transmissions occur indoors vs outdoors?

Recent analysis from China suggests that a large proportion of
transmission occurs indoors, particularly within homes and on transport.

Many outbreak reports describe indoor transmission, including
transmission within homes, churches[^41], hospitals[^42], gyms, and
restaurants[^43]. However, there may be selection bias as indoor
transmission is easier to trace and identify. Qian *et al*[^44] analyzed
318 outbreaks, involving 3 or more cases, between January 4 and February
11, from China, outside of Hubei province, and found that 80% of the
outbreaks are home outbreaks and 34% are transport outbreaks (some
outbreaks belong to more than one category); they identified one
outbreak in the outdoor setting.

#### What are the effects of cloth or homemade masks relative to surgical masks on droplet/aerosol spread and on viral load?

In addition to events such as coughs and sneezes producing respiratory
emissions, speech has also been found to produce substantial numbers of
droplets capable of containing respiratory pathogens[^15]. To this
effect, several studies have assessed the usefulness of different types
of masks in mitigating emissions from an individual to the environment.
Masks made from cloth or household materials have been found to filter
pathogens less effectively than surgical masks, with efficiency
estimates relative to surgical masks ranging from approximately 70% in a
study using bacteria and bacteriophage[^46], to approximately 50% in a
study of airborne particles[^47].

In terms of viral load, in a study of influenza, viral RNA was detected
in coarse (greater than 5 micron) particles from 11% of the volunteers
when they wore surgical masks, and from 43% of the volunteers when they
did not. In fine particles (less than 5 micron in size), viral RNA was
detected from 78% of individuals when wearing surgical masks and from
92% of individuals when they did not[^48]. This study concluded that the
surgical masks produced a 3.4 fold (95% CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in
viral copies in exhaled breath. Another recent study found that for
coronaviruses, surgical face masks reduced virus shedding in respiratory
droplets (greater than 5 micron) and aerosols (less than 5 micron)
emitted by symptomatic individuals[^49]. Specifically, coronaviruses
were detected in 30% and 40% of droplet and aerosol samples,
respectively, from symptomatic individuals not wearing masks, and in no
samples for both droplets and aerosols for symptomatic individuals
wearing surgical masks[^50].

#### Can masks be decontaminated and re-used? 

A few studies (e.g., Mills *et al* 2018[^51] and Lore *et al* 2012[^52])
have demonstrated that N95 masks can be reused if properly
decontaminated (e.g., by using Ultraviolet irradiation). There are
multiple studies on the effect of different decontamination procedures,
and that these will need to be considered in the development of any
guidance on mask use. A recent study by Kumar *et al*[^53] showed that
decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 on N95 masks can be done without impairing
their filtration efficiency for up to 10 cycles depending on the
decontamination method. Optimal decontamination procedures for cloth
masks need to be determined urgently.

### Observational and RCT Studies of Community Mask Wearing

#### Is there direct evidence on mask wearing in the community for decreasing onward transmission?

Virtually all studies on mask usage are focused on their use for the
protection of the wearer. These include the studies that are the subject
of current meta-analyses and reviews[^54] [^55] [^56]. Such studies do
not answer the question of whether mask use will provide source control.

To our knowledge, only two studies have been performed that studied the
effectiveness of mask use by the source patient with a viral respiratory
infection (mostly influenza) and tracking the development of viral
infection symptoms in others. Both studies used surgical masks and
monitored transmission to household members. Both studies have flaws,
the most serious of which were sample sizes that were too low or an
unexpectedly mild respiratory virus season. One additional study
examined the rates of viral respiratory tract infection in bone marrow
transplant patients when all health care workers and visitors to the
hospital ward wore surgical masks in comparison to infection rates prior
to the masking period.[^22]

The study by Canini *et al*[^58] was stopped early because of poor
enrollment; the study had only a 38% chance of detecting a 40%
additional protection by masking. Not unexpectedly, the study found no
masking effectiveness.

McIntyre *et al*[^59] studied the effectiveness of the use of a surgical
mask placed on a subject with a viral respiratory infection living in a
household of two or more people. They found that 15% of subjects not
assigned to mask wearing wore them, while 2% of subjects assigned to
wear them did not. Also, probably owing to a mild flu season, only 1 to
2% of household contacts developed illness versus the expected 20%. This
resulted in only a 9% chance of detecting a 50% decrease in illnesses in
mask-wearing households. However, after adjustments for mask wearing in
the index cases, the study found that wearing a surgical mask by the
infected person reduced the frequency of viral respiratory infection in
household members by 77% (95% CI 11 to 94% reduction).

It is important to note in both studies that mask wearing by the source
subjects was still infrequent, around 4 hours a day in both studies.
Because of the infrequent use of masks by the source patients, any
effect measured can be considered a minimal estimate when considering a
recommendation that masks be worn 100% of the time when physical
distancing is not possible or predictable in public. These studies
focused on the use of surgical masks, rather than cloth, limiting
extrapolation.

Sung *et al*[^22] studied the effect of a change in surgical mask use on a
bone marrow transplant use over a four-year period. Prior to this
change, masks were not worn routinely on the unit. Because the patients
were hospitalized for longer than the incubation period of viral
respiratory tract infections, and were in a HEPA-filtered protective
environment, all viral respiratory tract infections in the patients were
due to transmission from health care workers and visitors. In comparison
to the frequency of viral infection prior to universal mask use, mask
use resulted in about a 2.5-fold decrease in patient infections for
laboratory-confirmed viral infections, the majority of which were
parainfluenza viral infections (p\<0.001). To adjust for seasonal and
yearly variations in respiratory virus infections, a time-series
analysis was conducted, showing a significant reduction (60%, p = 0.02)
in viral infections due to mask use. Mask compliance was very high,
\>98%, for both healthcare workers and visitors. A limitation of this
study is its before-after design.

### Behavioural considerations 

#### Does wearing masks lead to more risky behaviour?

There is anecdotal evidence that masks can encourage negative behaviours
in professional settings (for instance industry). This is attributable
to desensitisation from extended wear and familiarity with the hazardous
material. However, there is no direct evidence that this is the case in
public settings where there is less chance for desensitisation. Further,
at a population level past introductions of safety measures like HIV
prevention measures, seatbelts and helmets have led to increased safety
and even increased safety oriented behaviour[^61].

#### Will universal use of face masks be accepted by the public? 

Survey data shows a high uptake of different forms of masks in Italy
(81%), a country with no history of widespread mask wearing[^62]. An
April 15th survey of 1,500 Britons found that 41% of respondents
believed that the public should be asked to wear masks, compared to 33%
who disagreed[^63] so there is some public support for this.

Insights from behavioural science suggest:

-   Because people view an action as correct in a given situation to the
    degree that they see others performing it[^64] [^65], there is an
    advantage to encouraging universal application in appropriate
    settings (such as public transport), with the aim of developing a
    critical mass of adherence and setting new norms around mask use. 

-   Because such norms act to inform observers that normative behaviour
    is both pragmatically prudent and morally proper[^66], information
    campaigns should convey that others are undertaking proper conduct
    for both practical and moral reasons, as that combination produces
    the greatest adherence[^67] [^68].

-   Because, especially in the case of new norms, adherence to a
    specific form of normative conduct can spur adherence to related
    forms of normative conduct[^69], the visibility of masks can be
    expected to act as a reminder of the need for physical distance,
    increased hand washing, reduced face touching, and group solidarity.

-   Because newly installed norms are unfamiliar and potentially
    unclear, explicit instructions about mask use (e.g., how to wear for
    adequate coverage and when to end mask use) may be necessary.

### International responses

#### What do we know about policy and impact of mask wearing in other countries?

The general approach among countries with policies in place for mask use
is to encourage a variety of materials to be used for face masks.
Countries that have implemented widespread use of masks early in their
national outbreak tend to have flatter curves than those that do not and
several officials cite implementing mask policies due to asymptomatic
transmission as a reason for this. Whilst this evidence is consistent
with a beneficial mask effect, many other factors complicate this
picture. Prior experience has been suggested as a factor influencing the
nature and implementation of public health policy in countries with
outbreaks of SARS and MERS.[^70]

1.  Policies and Mask Types

    In Europe, policy recommendations are mostly geared towards
    encouraging use of homemade or other non-surgical facial masks for
    the general population with the aim of providing readily-available
    protection, while reducing the risks of a limited surgical mask
    supply becoming unavailable for the healthcare professionals. Mask
    policies range from recommendations of different forms of homemade
    masks, from cloths, scarves and bandanas in Germany and the Czech
    Republic - with fines administered for non-compliance - to
    government-controlled surgical mask distribution in local
    pharmacies, such as KF94 masks in South Korea and N95 masks in
    Taiwan[^71]. More information on country policies are attached in
    the Appendix.

2.  Impact

    The difference in the rate of increase in cases after the 100th
    confirmed case in European countries with little or no mask
    wearing practices such as Spain and Italy, and Asian countries
    such as Taiwan and Hong Kong with stringent mask policies is
    notable (see figure below). However, it should be noted that New
    Zealand’s approach - which relies heavily on aggressive testing,
    tracing and quarantining of virus carriers, with lockdown measures
    in place - does not include universal mask policies[^72].

<img src="/diagrams/masks/image1.png" style="width:100%" />

*Fig. 1: Retrieved from Longrich and Sheppard (2020)*[^73]*.*

Korea’s government has also witnessed an uptake in mask use due to ease
of access: the number of pharmacies that sold all of their mask supplies
increased from 67.9% to 86.4% in 11 days[^74].

Similarly, in Hong Kong, a recent survey found that “85% of respondents
reported avoiding crowded places and 99% reported wearing face masks
when leaving home”[^75]. Microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung from Hong Kong,
who helped confirm the spread of COVID-19 in humans has stated that
apart from population control, mask-wearing, hand-washing, and social
distancing are all necessary and must be implemented early to suppress
transmission[^76]. This is indicative that clear guidance on mask use
aids mask uptake in the community.

Reasons for implementing public mask policies:

In Singapore, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong cited recent
fears of asymptomatic spread as one reason for the country’s
introduction of mask wearing: “We updated our advice on masks based on
the latest scientific evidence: the finding that people without symptoms
or very mild symptoms could be spreading the virus”[^77].

The Director General of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) highlights the prevention of virus transmission via
droplets expelled during speaking in close contact, particularly from
asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers, in their guidance: “The big
mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t
wearing masks. Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic
infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that
carry the virus from escaping and infecting others”[^78].

In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute, the national disease control and
prevention agency stated that “some infected people do not become ill at
all (asymptomatic infection), but could still pass it on to others.
Therefore, the wearing of temporary masks by people entering public
places where the safety distance cannot be maintained, e.g. public
transport, grocery stores or even at the workplace, could help to reduce
the spread of SARS-CoV-2”[^79].

#### WHO recommendations

The current World Health Organization (WHO)’s recommendation is to wear
a surgical mask to prevent onward transmission only if the wearer is
symptomatic or is treating someone suspected to have been infected by
COVID[^80]. However, this inevitably leads to discrepancies arising from
transmissions from those exhibiting no symptoms or are in the
pre-symptomatic phase[^81]. Further to this, previous studies conducted
on the effect of hand hygiene, facemask use and influenza transmission
found that hand hygiene alone was insufficient, but when coupled with
facemask use, there was reduced transmission[^82]. WHO are carrying out
further research to understand the efficacy of non-surgical masks and
will update their guidance when new evidence is available[^83].

#### Is there evidence that early adoption of public mask wearing in Czech Republic as compared to Austria mitigated epidemic spread?

There is anecdotal[^84] but no conclusive evidence. Government policies
of these neighbouring countries largely overlap, with lockdown occurring
on the same day. From lockdown, their relative growths in cumulative
infection counts match for 2½ weeks, when Austria follows the Czech
Republic and also introduces public mask-wearing. At that point new
Austrian cases *slow down* compared to the Czech Republic.

It is plausible that Austria’s comparative slow-down 2½ weeks after
lockdown should instead be attributed to **more comprehensive testing**,
which started 1½ weeks after lockdown. Austria broadened their testing
criteria *one week* before enforcing mask-wearing, testing anyone who
shows COVID-19 symptoms, as opposed to only those who also fill narrower
criteria (e.g. key workers only). The Czech Republic didn’t broaden
their testing criteria like Austria did in that period.
