  The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a global effort to develop, test,
  manufacture and distribute effective vaccines at unprecedented
  speed.  There are currently over 200 vaccine candidates in
  development and the results of initial large-scale trials are
  expected soon; however, to deliver a successful vaccination
  programme, many challenges remain. This report discusses the key
  issues involved in developing, evaluating, manufacturing and
  distributing a vaccine for COVID-19, the impact of those challenges
  and future strategies to mitigate their effects.<!--break-->

  **A successful vaccination programme must consider the suitability
  of different vaccines.** Key information that is needed to evaluate
  vaccines includes the ability to prevent disease in different
  groups, such as older people; the longevity of the immune response;
  the requirement for multiple doses and boosters; the ability to
  reduce infection and transmission of the virus; the tolerability and
  safety; the ability to be manufactured, distributed and administered
  at scale, affordability, and access and acceptability. Many of these
  properties will be unknown until well after the initial data on the
  first vaccine trials emerge.

  **Long term studies will be needed to establish vaccine
  effectiveness and longevity of protection.** Few vaccines give
  lifelong protection following a single dose. A partially protective
  vaccine may not be effective in priority groups, may allow onwards
  transmission, or could require higher vaccination rates to achieve
  the same levels of protection in a population. A vaccine of low
  efficacy may not achieve herd immunity. Rare adverse events or
  limited effectiveness in the field may only come to light when very
  large numbers of people are vaccinated.  Multiple doses may be
  needed to stimulate an effective level of immunity and if a
  candidate yields short-lived immunity, boosters may be required,
  with implications for manufacturing capacity, distribution and for
  generation of immunity in the wider population.

  **Further research is needed to understand the immune response to
  SARS-CoV-2 and the levels of immunity required for protection, and
  if and when immunity wanes.** We do not yet know which immune
  responses can protect against infection and can only determine
  whether a vaccine protects against disease by carrying out large
  scale trials. A better understanding of which immune responses are
  protective, using data from animal models, clinical trials and
  potentially human challenge studies will allow us to determine the
  correlates of protection and measure protection at an individual and
  population level. Standardisation of vaccine trials is needed to
  allow comparison and evaluation of different candidates.

  **Manufacturing will need to be scaled to meet the enormous demand
  of a global immunisation programme and vaccine availability is
  likely to be limited initially, requiring prioritisation of
  recipients.** The scale of manufacture required will depend on
  knowing the amount of active ingredient needed per dose, the number
  of doses needed, the production process needed and how long it will
  take to manufacture. Candidate vaccines using new technology are as
  yet unproven in their ability to be produced at scale but have the
  potential to be vastly more efficient in production than
  well-established platforms. For the overall vaccine manufacturing
  process, the bottlenecks could be the fill-to-finish process whereby
  the drug substance is filled into vials or other containers and the
  so-called drug product is obtained. Although some facilities can be
  repurposed, this is not the case for all stages in manufacture.

  **The vaccine manufacturing-distribution-administration chain
  represents a complex system with multiple parts and multiple
  objectives which are sometimes competing.** Production may be
  limited by supply chains of materials and delivery systems. The
  requirements for storage and transportation may limit distribution
  and access globally. Efforts might be required to improve
  thermostability of vaccines and minimise the requirement for low
  temperatures for distribution. The most important bottleneck here
  appears to be the final administration step.  Administration of a
  vaccine will require a large number of appropriately trained health
  workers with access to - and relationships with - different
  communities.

  **Unequal access and vaccine availability risks exacerbating health
  inequalities.** Ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately
  impacted by the pandemic and overcoming barriers to vaccination will
  require culturally sensitive collaboration. Criteria for vaccine
  prioritisation should be defined and made explicit. There should be
  public dialogue and engagement to manage expectations and
  understanding of vaccine effectiveness, safety, side effects,
  availability and access.

  **The diverse reasons for vaccine hesitancy will need to be
  addressed to engender public trust, with clear messaging targeted to
  different groups.** Acceptability will be determined by factors such
  as efficacy, doses required, side-effects, and perceived
  risks. There are a number of reasons for vaccine hesitancy and a
  range of strategies are needed, such as ‘convert communicators’,
  where those with previously strongly held opinions explain why they
  changed their mind. Other barriers to vaccine uptake such as
  financial disincentives should be removed.

  Vaccine strategies will need to be planned and revised on the basis
  of an integrated understanding of the emerging data on immunology,
  economics, manufacturing and behavioural issues, which will govern a
  successful vaccination programme.

  **Global collaboration is needed to ensure that vaccines will be
  affordable and available equitably, ensuring the greatest health
  outcomes**. International collaboration reduces the risks of
  investment and helps to secure global supplies and affordability.

  **Global coordination and investment will be needed in the longer
  term to provide preparedness for future pandemics.** The development
  of second-generation vaccines should be incentivised. Global
  coordination will be needed to protect all nations against
  outbreaks. Strategic vision and investment in scientific innovation
  and understanding of infectious disease, vaccine design, testing and
  manufacture as well as public expectations of vaccination will
  provide long-term solutions and preparedness.

# SARS-CoV-2 vaccines

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a global effort to develop, test,
manufacture and distribute effective vaccines at unprecedented speed.
There are currently over 200 vaccine candidates in development. A
successful vaccination programme will depend on understanding the
properties and effectiveness of different vaccine candidates, their
requirements for manufacture, distribution and administration, and
public acceptability.

## What constitutes an effective vaccine?

### How do vaccines work?

The immune response that follows infection can provide a long-lasting
immune ‘memory’ that protects against re-infection and disease. In the
same way, vaccines protect by mimicking a natural infection to stimulate
immune memory, but without causing disease. Most currently licensed
vaccines stimulate production of antibodies that bind specifically to
the virus eliminating the infection. Vaccines may also induce memory T
cells. T cells enhance the antibody response as well as directly
destroying virus-infected cells. While these are often protective,
antibodies and T cells can cause unwanted harmful effects (i.e.
immunopathology). Most vaccines under development for SARS-CoV-2 aim to
stimulate an effective immune response to one component of the virus,
the outer viral spike or S protein, whilst minimising the risks of
adverse effects.

### What makes an ideal vaccine?

An ideal vaccine is one that is safe and stimulates immune responses
that reduce both the risk or the severity of disease and the chance of
transmission of the infection. It should also confer long-term
protection so people do not need to be frequently re-vaccinated. Few
vaccines meet all these ideals.

Typically only a proportion of those vaccinated mount a sufficiently
strong immune response to protect against disease (this is the vaccine
efficacy), and particular groups such as older people often respond
poorly to vaccines due to aging of the immune system. Vaccines typically
also reduce transmission of the virus from those who have been
vaccinated to others, and so protect those who are unvaccinated or
respond poorly to immunisation, however a vaccine that reduces disease
but not infection can theoretically still allow transmission to occur.

For example, influenza vaccines are usually only partially effective
(particularly in the high-risk groups targeted such as older people) and
changes to the circulating virus renders the immunity useless after a
time, so annual re-vaccination is required. However, even partial
protection can have important benefits, with for example the FluEnz
nasal spray vaccine not only reducing disease in children but also
reducing spread of disease to their older relatives.

## What immune responses can protect against COVID-19?

We do not yet know which immune responses, if any, protect against
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibodies and T cells can be detected in the
majority of those who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it
is not known whether infection leads to protection against reinfection
or severe disease nor how long any immunity lasts. As such, we don’t
know which types of immune response should be stimulated by a vaccine to
protect against infection.

### The role of antibodies 

Evidence from natural infection with seasonal “common cold”
coronaviruses suggests that immune responses generated after infection
are associated with protection against re-infection. However, this
response wanes and after a year re-infection may occur in about
two-thirds of previously infected people, although most have few if any
symptoms.[^1]
Antibodies typically appear a few weeks after infection but wane within
2-3 years. Similar studies following SARS-CoV-2 infection are in
progress. Currently, the only SARS-CoV-2 data are from non-human
primates, in which the presence of antibodies that bind and block the
virus correlates with protection.[^2],[^3]
Neutralising antibodies can in principle act to prevent viral entry and
replication in cells, thus preventing infection. Neutralising antibodies
that bind to the outer spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have
been identified in most people who have recovered from infection,
[^4],[^5],[^6],[^7],[^8] but whether these are protective remains to be confirmed.

### The role of T cells

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are detectable in convalescing patients
following COVID-19,[^9],[^10],[^11],[^12],[^13]
but their role in protection is not known. Studies have reported that
virus-specific T cells are detectable even in those who do not have
detectable levels of antibody, and in those who experienced mild or
asymptomatic infection.[^13],[^14]
Thus T cell responses may prove to be a more reliable test of prior
exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than serological tests for antibodies, and a
better test for population surveys of previous infection. However, the
longevity of T cell responses is not known, and tests for the presence
of T-cells are technically more demanding than those for antibodies. T
cells produced following SARS-CoV (SARS) infection were still detectable
after more than 11 years, whereas the antibody response waned over 2-3
years.[^15],[^16],[^17]
Most studies of T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 have been able to measure
responses at least a month after symptom onset.

Generally, immunity is very specific for a particular infection, such
that antibodies and T cells produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection will
only recognise that virus. However, different coronaviruses may be
similar enough to each other that T cells against coronaviruses are
cross-reactive. Several groups have reported the presence of T cells in
individuals with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which nevertheless
recognise SARS-CoV-2. These T cells may be developed in response to
circulating common cold strains of coronavirus,
[^9],[^10],[^17],[^18]
although not all reports agree.
[^12]
Cross-reactive T cells may contribute to protection against COVID-19,
potentially reducing severity of infection, and influencing responses to
vaccination.
[^10] If
so, then vaccines that stimulate T cells are likely to confer more
efficient protection than that given by antibodies alone.

### Immune enhancement of disease 

While antibodies and T cells are often helpful, they can also be
destructive and enhance inflammation if present in the wrong proportions
or mis-targeted, or if they enhance entry of the virus into cells.
Historically, this has occurred with some vaccines (which commonly focus
on inducing high levels of a single type of immune response), leading to
vaccine-enhanced disease. There is a risk that this could occur
following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.[^19],[^20],[^21]
Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) occurred following vaccination
against a feline coronavirus[^20],[^22] and the potential for antibody enhanced uptake of virus can be
demonstrated in the laboratory for the related MERS and SARS-CoV-1
viruses.[^23],[^24],[^25]
Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccine development may prove
useful for assessing safety in this context
[^26] but there is currently no reliable predictive measurement of immune enhanced
disease, whether in all recipients or in individuals.[^21]
Although this remains a theoretical risk, all clinical vaccine trials
should therefore include long-term follow-up of vaccinated individuals
at sufficient scale to assess for unexpectedly severe disease on
subsequent natural SARS-CoV-2 infection that might be due to immune
enhancement.

## What is the current situation with vaccines in clinical development?

Over 200 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are currently in development
[^27],[^28],[^29],[^30][<span
class="underline">(Appendix
2)</span>](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines).
Some candidates that are in the later stages of clinical trials (e.g.
the Oxford/Astrazeneca ChAdOx1) are based on “viral vectors”, where part
of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic code is inserted into another harmless virus.
[^31],[^32],[^33],[^34]
When the harmless virus enters a cell, it produces the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein which stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies and
memory cells against this viral protein. An alternative design is where
the viral genetic code is produced as an RNA vaccine (e.g. Moderna),
which also leads to the production of viral protein when it enters a
cell.
[^35]
Other candidates include protein subunit-based vaccines, where viral
protein is produced in culture, and inactivated virus, where the whole
virus is grown in culture, before being inactivated. Some vaccines will
be formulated with adjuvants, which promote inflammation that enhances
antibody production. Some of the current vaccines in development, such
as inactivated virus formulations, are based on well established
technologies with a track record of widespread use, whereas others, such
as RNA vaccines, have not previously been used in a licenced vaccine.
For the purposes of speed, almost all vaccines under development will be
delivered intramuscularly as this is the simplest and best understood
mode of delivery. However, since intramuscular injections do not
specifically stimulate antibodies or T cells in the nose or lung, they
may not be the most efficient at preventing disease or transmission in
the airway.

Clinical development of these early candidates has been accelerated to
an unprecedented level, with the Oxford, Moderna and Sinovac vaccines
among those that have started large-scale field trials internationally.
However, the history of vaccine development is littered with candidates
that have failed at this late stage, due for example to poor
immunogenicity, and there is no guarantee that these vaccines will be
effective. If vaccines were deployed outside clinical trials before
safety and efficacy have been fully established and prove to be
ineffective or cause rare but severe side effects during the
larger-scale roll-out, they could cause substantial harm and damage
public confidence in other vaccines. Strict regulation of clinical
trials and robust licensing rules must therefore be maintained in spite
of the urgency and requirement for speedy implementation.

As data from vaccine trials emerge, vaccine candidates will need to be
evaluated for their suitability for use in different populations. The
success of a vaccine programme will depend on vaccine efficacy,
availability and uptake.


# Ensuring the success of a vaccine programme: vaccine efficacy

-   Vaccines are unlikely to yield 100% protection in all recipients and
    may vary in their ability to produce immune responses and memory to
    SARS-CoV-2

-   As a result, vaccines might have differing abilities to prevent
    disease and transmission in different groups and the longevity of
    protection

-   Standardisation of clinical trials and immunological laboratory
    tests is required to evaluate and compare different vaccine
    candidates

-   Correlates of protection need to be established to enable rapid
    monitoring of immunity in individuals and the wider population

-   Partial protection following vaccination may require multiple doses
    and boosters to achieve immunity at an individual level and high
    levels of vaccine coverage in a population to achieve immunity

-   Animal models and human challenge studies may increase our
    understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and expedite vaccine
    development

-   More basic research is needed to understand the nature of protective
    immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection

## Testing and evaluation of vaccine candidates

### Different vaccine candidates have different properties

Different vaccines will generate distinctive immune responses, and
therefore have different abilities to prevent infection, transmission
and disease. Immunity generated may be mainly antibody-mediated or a
more balanced antibody and T cell response
[^36](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=1306209&pre=&suf=&sa=0). A
variety of T cell types can be produced, with different abilities to
protect against infection and form memory cells. Memory may be short or
long-lived. Different vaccines may require single or multiple doses to
induce a good memory response and will differ in the immediate unwanted
side effects (reactogenicity) that will influence vaccine uptake and
acceptability
[^37](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8896765&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Vaccines may work less well in certain groups, particularly in older
people who often respond poorly to vaccination and are particularly
vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.

While preventing lung disease is a key goal of a vaccine, stopping
transmission may not be possible if infection and viral shedding still
takes place. This may depend on the route of immunisation and the
subsequent location of generated immunity. Systemic vaccination via for
example injection into a muscle, may not induce good local immune
responses in the airways, so may not prevent upper respiratory tract
infection, viral shedding or transmission even if it protects the lung.
This phenomenon has been seen in non-human primates studies
[^3](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8934337&pre=&suf=&sa=0). The
majority of vaccines currently under development administer the vaccine
by the intramuscular route. Phase III clinical trials currently underway
use a reduction in COVID-19 disease in vaccine recipients as their
primary endpoint, and information on the ability of the vaccine to
prevent onward transmission will not be available. Although most
vaccines do prevent both disease and onward transmission, transmission
remains a possibility that would need to be studied in community trials
where the incidence of infection in unvaccinated recipients is
determined.

The *efficacy* of a vaccine, that is its ability to protect an
individual, under ideal circumstances in the context of a clinical
trial, should be distinguished from *effectiveness* of a vaccine which
is determined as the sum of reduction in clinical events in the real
world and which is influenced by both vaccine efficacy and many other
factors.

### Identifying correlates of protection will aid measurement of vaccine efficacy

Vaccine trials will determine the efficacy of protection against
symptomatic infection within a relatively short time. For many vaccines,
having high levels of antibodies and/or T cells is associated with
efficacy. These immune markers may then act as correlates of protection
so that their measurement can be used as a surrogate to predict vaccine
efficacy.
[^38],[^39]

Once correlates of protection are identified they might be used in
vaccine trials and allow researchers to estimate vaccine efficacy before
larger scale or more complex trials such as population-level field
studies (which take time and large numbers of volunteers) or human
infection challenge studies with deliberate infection of volunteers
(which tend to be small scale and have accompanying risks with ethical
implications that need careful thought ([<span
class="underline">Appendix
1</span>](#appendix-1-human-challenge-studies))). If the correlates are
well understood, they might be used to rapidly assess whether an
individual responds to a vaccine and is likely to be protected.
Appropriate correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
Correlates will probably differ depending on the desired outcome
measure, such as protection against infection itself, prevention of
symptomatic infection or severe disease, or transmission.
[^38]
Protection invoked by a vaccine may rely on different components of the
immune system to those that develop following natural infection.

In cases where antibody protects against a virus infection, we need to
measure the amount of antibody produced following vaccination (the
antibody titre) and know whether this is above a protective threshold.
Measurement of antibodies in the blood, the most commonly used correlate
of protection, is relatively simple to perform in diagnostic
laboratories, and can be standardised across different laboratories by
use of reference samples. We do not yet know if there is an antibody
level that represents protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further
complexity is added because as well as the quantity of antibodies, the
properties of the antibodies will determine how well they protect.
Neutralising antibodies which block the ability of the virus to infect
cells may be the best correlate of protection, but neutralisation assays
are technically difficult and are not used for routine diagnostic tests.
Many commercial tests detect antibodies to the nucleoprotein (N) of the
virus to which there is a strong antibody response. While this helps to
maximise sensitivity of the test, N protein is found on the inside of
the virus particle, so these antibodies may not prevent infection nor
act as a good correlate of protection.

Whilst antibodies are an easily accessible and measurable component of
immunity, a balanced and efficient immune response includes the
formation of long-lived memory T cells to provide optimal protection
against re-infection. However, T cell measurements are difficult to
carry out and techniques used differ in different laboratories.
Nevertheless, work is ongoing to develop and partially standardise these
methods in both academic and commercial labs. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) recommends that studies of the immune response to
vaccine candidates should include both antibody responses, including
neutralisation assays, and assessment of the T cell responses.
[^40]

### Standardisation of Clinical Trials

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials, in prioritising speed due to the critical
health need, may generate data that are difficult to interpret.
Different trials have employed different methods both in the design of
the study and in the laboratory measurements used. This will make
comparing the relative merits of different vaccine candidates difficult.
Standardisation of study design and agreeing on core end points and
their hierarchical ordering in vaccine trials will allow comparison of
different vaccine candidates and aid vaccine development. One difficulty
in establishing correlates of protection is that different tests may be
performed by different laboratories using different definitions of
immunity. Standardisation of immunological assays as well as clinical
endpoints would allow comparison of data across trials.
[^41]
International availability of and requirements to use standard reagents
will ensure consistency across different studies.

Funders such as The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations
(CEPI) have made efforts to standardise the studies they support but
comparability of data will need to be a priority for both funders and
policymakers. This is particularly important when considering the
differences between studies conducted in different countries.

Furthermore, while there is good evidence that some minority ethnic
groups have experienced worse COVID-19 health outcomes than their white
counterparts, it remains the case that volunteers from ethnic minorities
are routinely under-represented in trials even when these groups are
specifically targeted with advertising and public engagement.[^42]
Trial populations should be reported and reflect the ethnicity of the
groups most affected by the pandemic. Since the pandemic has amplified
inequalities associated with ethnicity and health it is essential to
understand why volunteer participation in some minority groups is low
and how to increase vaccine acceptance in them.

### Limitations of Clinical Trials

Outside of pandemics, clinical vaccine development is a slow and
incremental process to ensure safety and reduce the risk of cumulative
investment in products which fail due to ineffectiveness or side
effects. Clinical trials are thus typically divided into phases I, II
and III, which take place sequentially, investigating safety in the
early phases and efficacy in large scale trials later with increasing
numbers of volunteers required. This has been accelerated in the testing
of SARS-CoV2 vaccines. Efficacy can only be shown when there is
sufficient circulation of the infection to demonstrate a reduction in
cases in vaccinated people. Studies in Brazil, South Africa and the USA
are likely to be the only ones in which this may be currently possible
for SARS-CoV-2, although targeting high-incidence groups such as
healthcare workers may have a role. There are risks that study quality
might suffer if clinical trials are accelerated to catch pandemic waves:
(43).There are also implications for the ethics of vaccine studies in
low and middle income countries (LMIC), public trust and vaccine
acceptance, as highlighted by recent demonstrations in South Africa
against some vaccine studies, which some believe to be exploiting local
populations.[^44]

The FDA has stipulated a requirement of 50% efficacy for licensure.[^40]
Current trials primarily measure efficacy as a reduction in symptomatic
infection, rather than infection per se or severe disease, furthermore
different trials use different definitions of symptomatic infection. The
first vaccine trials will not tell us how long immunity lasts and the
need for booster doses. They will not reveal whether onwards
transmission occurs if for example, symptoms are reduced but mild or
asymptomatic infection still occurs. Long term and rare side effects may
not be detected and so long term phase IV safety monitoring will be
essential once vaccines are licenced for clinical use.

### Benefits and Limitations of Animal Models

Animals, including non-human primates (NHP), have been used to determine
whether protective immunity is generated following SARS-CoV-2 infection,
to test vaccines and determine protective mechanisms. Safety testing of
vaccines in animal models can help to predict potential harmful effects
including vaccine enhanced disease upon infection. Non-human primates
can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they possess a similar ACE2 receptor
(which the virus uses to infect cells) to humans[^2],[^45],[^46]
and SARS-CoV-2 challenged or vaccinated rhesus macaques demonstrated
protection against reinfection.[^2],[^3],[^47]
Small animals can also be infected, including transgenic mice which have
been engineered to express the human ACE2 receptor.[^48],[^49],[^50],[^51],[^52],[^53]
The Syrian golden hamster in particular has emerged as a suitable animal
model for SARS-CoV-2 and has been used to demonstrate the protective
effect of antibodies.[^54]
However, data from animal experiments must be interpreted with caution.
Rechallenge studies have so far been undertaken only a short time after
vaccination or primary infection, so the longevity of protection is not
known, furthermore variation in models employed reduces our ability to
compare different vaccines.[^33],[^55]
Animal immune systems differ fundamentally from the human immune system
in certain respects we understand and possibly ways we do not understand
yet, experimental animals are often housed under unusually clean
conditions and lack experience of infections and other diseases, and the
doses of virus used in animal experiments tend to be much higher than
those encountered in natural human infection.[^45],[^49],[^51],[^56]
NHPs are currently viewed as the most useful model but are very
expensive so numbers used are very small. NHPs are also outbred so
results can be highly variable and most animal models (including NHPs)
do not show much disease or pathology with SARS-CoV-2.

### Can human infection challenge studies accelerate vaccine development?

To address gaps in understanding of protective immunity and to develop a
strategy for selecting or rejecting vaccine candidates, human infection
challenge with SARS-CoV-2 is being considered[^57]
([<span class="underline">Appendix
1</span>](#appendix-1-human-challenge-studies)). Human infection
challenges with influenza and other respiratory viruses have been
conducted safely for many decades and have provided critical knowledge
for the development of vaccines. By deliberately inoculating volunteers
with a well-characterised virus, a consistent and guaranteed high
infection rate is achieved so fewer participants are required to show
evidence of protective efficacy. Vaccine testing therefore avoids
relying on exposure of individuals to natural infection in the
community, which may be limited or unpredictably variable. Using a human
challenge system, candidate vaccines can be quickly assessed for the
immunity they elicit and whether that affects the infection rate. In the
case of SARS-CoV-2, the novelty of the virus and uncertainties about
effective treatment or long-term complications require careful
consideration to balance the risks to individual volunteers and benefit
to society in accelerating the development of effective vaccines,
especially when field trials using community exposure are still possible
albeit only in some places
[^58–60](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8984878,9072479,9232872&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0).
The WHO has published an ethical framework for SARS-CoV-2 challenge
studies and a number of groups are considering strategies to mitigate
risk. Specifically, COVID-19 is now known to cause mild or asymptomatic
disease in the vast majority of young adults, so restricting the age
range of enrolled volunteers and limiting disease with antivirals may
render the system safer. This is clearly a limitation in that vaccines
cannot be tested in groups such as the older people in whom the risks of
challenge are higher. Furthermore, challenge studies do not tell us
about the effectiveness of a vaccine programme in the real world. Key
steps to developing this model will be to generate a stock of SARS-CoV-2
that is suitable for administration to volunteers; expert consensus on
how such studies should be run safely; and identification of the
facilities and resources to conduct the studies while minimising risk to
study participants and people in the surrounding community to an
acceptable level.

## Partially effective vaccines

The ideal vaccine would generate life-long immunity to infection
following a single dose. In reality, this level of protection is
frequently not achieved and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development are
unlikely to result in complete protection against infection in all
recipients.

Partial immunity in a population may result from differences in the way
individuals respond to the vaccine, with only a proportion of those
immunised producing a strong enough immune response to be protected.
Vaccine efficacy is typically measured as the proportion of those
vaccinated who are protected from symptomatic infection. For example,
inactivated influenza vaccines have an average efficacy in preventing
confirmed influenza infection of around 59% of individuals
[^61](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=4992963&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Differences in the response of individuals to a vaccine may in part be
explained because certain groups, such as children or older people,
often respond poorly to vaccines.

Partial immunity in an individual may result because the response
generated by a vaccine does not completely protect recipients against
infection, but for example, reduces the severity of disease. Viral
replication might be reduced but may potentially allow transmission to
occur. For example, the recent trials of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in
primates, resulted in a reduction in clinical severity and amount of
virus in the lungs of vaccinated animals, but did not reduce viral
shedding from the nose
[^33](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9359413&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

Partial immunity might result because over time protective immune memory
responses wane. Re-exposure to the pathogen or a booster vaccine can
reactivate immune memory and restore levels of protective immunity.
Partial immunity may also theoretically contribute to immune enhancement
on subsequent infection due to imbalances in the different arms of
immunity.

The WHO gives a Target Product Profile for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as
inducing a minimum of 6 months but preferably at least a year of
protection, with efficacy in at least 50% of the population (preferably
70%) including in older people.[^62]

We show in Figure 1 how these concepts are related to population-level
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 due to natural infection or vaccination.

<img src="/diagrams/vaccines/image1.png" style="width:100%" />

**Figure 1:** Population-level immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Primary infection gives rise to different degrees of immunity in
different individuals (dark blue population, top right). Over time, this
natural immunity may wane, making some individuals susceptible to
secondary infection. People with primary infection typically experience
more severe disease and shed more virus than those with a secondary
infection, and so are more infectious (larger red arrows than pink
arrows). Fewer people with secondary infection are likely to need
hospitalization than those with primary infections, although there is a
theoretical risk of greater severity in secondary infections due to
phenomena such as antibody-dependent enhancement. An effective vaccine
would provide immunity to fully susceptible individuals without
requiring infection, although this immunity may also wane, possibly at a
rate different from natural immunity.

### Partial immunity means higher vaccination rates are required

Intuitively, if the proportion in the population vaccinated with an
effective vaccine is sufficiently high, then immunity generated by a
fully transmission-blocking vaccine could control or eliminate the
infection: this is called herd immunity. However, herd immunity becomes
harder to achieve when vaccine-induced or natural immunity is partial
and/or short-lived, allowing secondary infections to occur, or when
logistical or other constraints limit vaccine deployment and coverage.
The authors in[^63]
employed simple epidemiological models to explore the impact of a
partially transmission-blocking vaccine on the timing and number of
future COVID-19 infections. The analysis in[^63]
assumes that vaccine immunity has a finite duration and reduces the
vaccinated individual’s susceptibility to natural infection to a level
below that of an unvaccinated person. Although successful vaccines may
operate on the basis of the generation of a memory T cell or antibody
response against the pathogen (as previously discussed in the immunology
section), these details are not explicitly considered in,[^63]
and instead are accounted for more generally through the parameters
describing the effectiveness of the vaccine-induced immune response.

<img src="/diagrams/vaccines/image2.png" style="width:100%" />

**Figure 2:** Schematic of qualitative vaccination rate required to
eliminate infections as a function of the effectiveness and duration of
vaccinal immunity adapted from
[^63].

The results in[^63]
suggest that both the effectiveness of a vaccine and the duration of the
immunity it confers affect the vaccination coverage required to achieve
a disease-free state at equilibrium (see Figure 2). With a fully
transmission-blocking vaccine, relatively low vaccination rates are
required to achieve zero infections at steady state. However, as
immunity becomes more imperfect, increasingly high vaccination rates are
required to eliminate infections particularly when the duration of
vaccine immunity is short. This illustrates that reductions in infection
achievable through vaccination are inherently related to the efficacy of
the vaccine and the nature of the adaptive immune response, yet even an
imperfect vaccine could have important impacts on SARS-CoV-2 infection
dynamics and control.

Several practical aspects related to vaccine deployment bear mentioning
in the context of the discussion of this work. For the most part,[^63]
considers a uniform, well-mixed population, and the authors show that
their results are qualitatively robust to considerations of
heterogeneity in the transmission of and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
between individuals. However, the existence of these heterogeneities
will necessitate a careful, equitable rollout and distribution of a
vaccine when it becomes available, particularly if it is only partially
protective and its initial availability is limited. Specifically, in
order to reduce strain on healthcare systems, individuals at higher risk
of acquiring severe infections (i.e. older people and those with
comorbidities), or those with higher re-transmission potential might
need to be prioritised.

### What might influence the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines?

The response to vaccination differs widely between individuals for
reasons not completely understood. However, for SARS-CoV-2, older adults
will be a particularly problematic group as they are both most
susceptible to severe disease and less likely to mount an effective
immune response following vaccination. This is likely due to ageing of
the immune system. Potentially, emergence of new strains of virus might
also limit efficacy of a vaccine. To enhance vaccine-induced immunity,
strategies include repeat vaccination, vaccinating with higher doses,
administering boosters and adding vaccine components that enhance
immunogenicity by engaging other arms of the immune system (adjuvants).
Different vaccines will stimulate different components of the immune
response to differing degrees; some will induce higher levels of
neutralising antibodies and others will induce a stronger T cell memory.
Mucosally delivered vaccines may afford better protection at mucosal
sites such as the respiratory tract.

Re-vaccination may be required as immunity wanes. The requirement for
boosting will influence the choice of vaccine platform as not all
vaccines will be suitable for repeated vaccination if immunity to the
vaccine itself is acquired. This may occur particularly with viral
vectored vaccines, where the immune response generated to the viral
vector itself would remove the vector before it could sufficiently
restimulate the immune system. A prime-boost strategy may therefore
require a combination of different vaccines. The need for boosting has
implications for the cost and access to a vaccine, potentially
increasing the number of doses that need to be produced, requiring
long-term increases in manufacturing capabilities and adding complexity
to a vaccination programme, including acceptance. Prime-boost strategies
must be specifically tested in clinical trials of appropriate groups.

## Further research is required to determine how the immune response can protect against SARS-CoV-2

Ultimately, the ability to properly plan for the level of vaccination
required and who to prioritise will depend on an improved understanding
of the nature and duration of vaccine immunity, disease susceptibility
and transmission.[^64],[^[65],[^66]
To interpret the results of different trials and to aid the design of
future trials, further research is needed to understand which immune
responses protect against infection and disease, and should be the goal
of any vaccine candidate.[^41]
How and which antibody responses and the threshold amount of antibody
needed to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. Most
vaccines under development aim to elicit antibody responses to the S
protein, but the importance of immunological recognition of other
components of the virus is far less well understood and vaccines that
include more than one component of the virus may prove to be more
effective. In addition to neutralisation, different types of antibodies
(isotypes) vary in their ability to direct other components of the
immune response towards the virus or virally infected cells. However,
the relative importance of different antibody isotypes to the outcome of
SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be established.

Additionally, the location of antibodies and T cells may be critically
important. It is likely that local immunity in the nose and lung will be
more effective in preventing viral shedding and pneumonia. While
antibodies and cellular responses are most frequently measured in blood
due to ease of access, those found in the airways can be a better
correlate of protection for respiratory infection than serum antibodies.
For example, IgA, an antibody which is known to be produced following
SARS-CoV-2 infection, may act as a first barrier to infection.[^67]
These local immune responses are less well understood and therefore
research in this area needs priority.

Further research is also needed to understand the timing of the T cell
response, its longevity, what factors determine the development of good
T cell memory and whether it is a good correlate of protection. If we
can determine what parts of the virus are recognised by T cells these
may be good candidates for inclusion in a vaccine. Furthermore, there
are different types of T cells with different functions and the role of
these subsets will need to be better understood so that the optimal T
cells responses can be tested for and vaccines designed to promote these
responses. T cells in the airway have special features that may enhance
protection but are not stimulated by intramuscular vaccines, and mucosal
vaccines, such as those delivered intranasally, might be particularly
effective at stimulating production of these T cells. Investigating
these features and standardising assays should overcome many issues
resulting in conflicting data on T cell responses from different
studies.


# Ensuring the success of a vaccination programme: vaccine availability

-   Financial investment and advanced purchasing agreements have
    incentivised rapid development and production of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
    and an increase in global capacity for vaccine manufacture

-   International collaboration in development of multiple vaccine
    candidates reduces the risk to individual countries and companies,
    and increases availability and affordability

-   Expansion of global vaccine manufacturing capacity represents a
    major challenge

-   Not all vaccines under development have a proven ability to be
    produced at scale

-   Supply chains for manufacture and distribution may limit
    availability

-   Administration of vaccines is a significant bottleneck and will
    require trained personnel working within communities

-   Unequal access to a vaccine risks exacerbating national and global
    health inequalities and might thwart efforts to control SARS-CoV-2
    for all countries

## Financial incentives for vaccine development

The COVID pandemic has caused enormous global economic damage. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that the cumulative output
loss over 2020-21 could be $9 trillion, with the global economy
projected to contract by 3% in 2020.[^68] In
addition to the health impact, the macroeconomic impact of an effective
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has convinced governments, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) and industry to make unprecedented levels of
investment to accelerate vaccine development and manufacture.

The typical economic model of development of any new pharmaceutical or
vaccine is driven by identification of patient and market demand,
large-scale high-risk R&D investment, patents that preserve market
monopoly and prices set by willingness to pay and investment needs for
future development. Historically, development of new vaccines is seen as
high risk and has typically taken around 10 years at a cost estimated as
between $500 million to $1-2bn, with a likelihood of entering the market
of only 6-7%.[^69],[^70],[^71]

Both ‘push’ and ‘pull’ incentives can be used to finance vaccine
development and both have been used to accelerate the development of
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.[^72],[^73],[^74]
‘Push’ funding finances investment in basic research and development of
both the vaccine and manufacturing capacity without the need for a
specific goal to be achieved, thereby reducing the cost for the
developer. ‘Pull’ funding has been used to accelerate the development,
availability and uptake of vaccines and other medical products, by
guaranteeing reward for successful development.[^72],[^74],[^75]
An example of ‘pull’ funding are Advanced Market Commitments (AMCs),
purchase agreements that can be used to guarantee price and quantity of
vaccines purchased before the results of clinical trials are known and
in advance of licencing.[^74],[^76]
AMC have been used, most notably, by the global vaccine alliance Gavi, a
public-private partnership, to secure supply of vaccines for preventing
pneumococcal disease in low income countries.[^76],[^77]
A purchase guarantee at a fixed price incentivises and de-risks vaccine
development and investment in manufacturing capacity for the provider,
and secures affordable vaccine supply for the purchaser,[^74],[^78]
although AMC have been criticised for the relatively high price paid.[^79]
The concerns about high prices may be ameliorated if joint negotiations
are carried out by multiple countries. For SARS-CoV-2 vaccines such
advanced investment in developing vaccines and manufacturing capacity
before a vaccine is licenced will ensure rapid availability of vaccines
once successful candidates are identified. In addition to securing
vaccine development, supply chains for adjuvants and bioreactors need to
be strengthened in parallel to avoid delays in and failure of
vaccination drives.

Individual governments have acted to secure vaccine supplies. To date,
the UK government is reported to have made forward purchasing deals to
secure over 300 million vaccine doses, potentially enough for almost 5
doses per person,[^80] with the USA, European Union and Japan also securing hundreds of
millions of doses[^81] (Table 1). The UK government has invested in vaccine manufacturing facilities
to increase capacity, for example, in partnership with biotech company
Valneva in Livingston, West Lothian, as well as supporting the fast
track construction of the UK Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre
(VMIC).[^82],[^83]
Furthermore, the government has secured other necessary supplies for
example, ordering 65 million injection devices for autumn 2020.[^84]
The US government has invested in the development of vaccine candidates
under Operation Warp Speed.[^85]

<img src="/diagrams/vaccines/image3.png" style="width:100%" />

**Figure 3:** Probability of success as a function of number of
candidates. Source: <https://www.AcceleratingHT.org/>.

It is advantageous for countries to unite in their negotiations with
multiple firms for development and manufacturing of vaccines; this will
ensure a higher probability of success, with more vaccination at a lower
overall cost.[^86] The model illustrated in Fig 3 suggests that it would be optimal to
invest in 20 vaccine candidates to ensure the likelihood of success to
be above 0.8, and this is the point at which the economic benefits of
advancing vaccine development and manufacturing capacity are optimised
(Michael Kremer, personal communication; for more details, see <https://www.AcceleratingHT.org/>.[^87]

COVAX is a global collaboration on COVID-19 vaccines coordinated by
Gavi, CEPI and the WHO, which aims to secure billions of doses of
affordable SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which will be available to all
participating nations, securing sufficient supply initially for 3% and
then 20% of participating countries' populations
[^79,88,89](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9089111,9644104,9644101&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0).
COVAX aims to secure $18.1bn in funding to support the development,
procurement and delivery of 2 billion doses of vaccines by the end of
2021. The Gavi COVAX AMC will fund access for lower-income countries. To
date 170 nations including 76 wealthy nations, have expressed intent to
participate in the scheme, including a UK commitment of £571m
[^90](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9644109&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Such international collaboration to invest in multiple vaccine
candidates reduces the risk to individual countries, strengthens their
negotiating position and helps to secure global supplies, reduces the
risk that ‘vaccine nationalism’ could reduce availability, and that a
bidding war could increase prices
[^72,81](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9514747,9531006&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0),
rendering vaccines unaffordable to LMIC. The participation of a
significant number of high-income countries will likely create
incentives for others to join the syndicate. If it is politically
impossible for all countries to join, informal coordination of
initiatives should be pursued (Michael Kremer, personal communication).
Furthermore, cooperative allocation of vaccine doses once available is
likely to have greater overall health outcomes, in terms of lives saved,
than unequal allocation to wealthier nations
[^91](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9666209&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

Ensure Equitable and Fair Allocation of COVID-19 products.

## Challenges in manufacture of a future vaccine

Once a safe and effective vaccine is available the choice of vaccination
strategies will need to be phased to match manufacturing capacity. CEPI
estimates that for 2021 a global annual capacity of between 2 to 4
billion doses could be available without disrupting existing vaccine
supplies with much of the capacity being in India and China
[^92](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9646232&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
They hope to distribute 2.1 billion doses in 2020/1 and will target
high-risk individuals. If immunity is short lived and annual vaccine
boosters are needed, capacity will be needed to extend coverage whilst
maintaining immunity in existing recipients. A vaccine that confers
immunity for less than a year would only be useful in limited
circumstances, such as managing outbreaks and in high risk individuals,
as the logistics of large scale manufacturing, distribution and use
become unworkable for widespread vaccination programmes.

The outstanding issues that need to be established in order to define
the manufacturing challenges are:

1.  Will we find a vaccine that works?

2.  What will the vaccine strategy be?

3.  Will the vaccine require single or multiple doses?

4.  How long will an immune response be protective and how will a
    booster strategy work to maintain protection?

5.  What process will be used to make the vaccine?

6.  What is the amount of the active ingredient (drug substance) per
    dose?

7.  How long will it take to manufacture the required number of doses?

8.  What route of administration will be used for the vaccine?

9.  How long will it take to distribute and administer the required
    number of doses?

10. Is the vaccine suitable for worldwide distribution?

### UK capacity to develop and make a COVID-19 vaccine

It is clear that worldwide there will be a long lag time to reach a
suitable level of sustainable manufacturing
[^93](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8776842&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
With vaccine development normally taking over 10 years and costing 1 to
2 billion pounds, capacity has been built as needed. To build a new
biotechnology manufacturing and filling facility can typically take 3-5
years from start to end of commissioning.

At present the UK is constrained in vaccine manufacturing capacity.
Because of consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry the UK has
capacity to make influenza vaccines and some childhood vaccines but is
limited in the availability of sites for further work within the UK.
Most of the promising candidates will be taken up by large
pharmaceutical companies that are international in outlook. They have
the experience of managing large projects and organising large-scale
clinical trials, analysing data and registering products. With
pharmaceutical companies taking an international view and focussing on a
few key production sites for vaccines such as GSK focussing vaccines at
Rixensart and Wavre in Belgium there are fewer local facilities with
local expertise and capacity.

There are many reasons to make a product on multiple sites; supply
security, being close to the user and local knowledge for regulatory
issues. However, technology transfer and keeping consistency between
sites requires effort and cross cultural understanding. It is feasible
that material could be made on a site for one market but not be
available for use in other markets because of site registration issues
or export restrictions.

To speed up vaccine development in the short term, disposable technology
is being used to initiate production using existing facilities that can
be repurposed. In the long-term extra capacity will be needed for
vaccine supply at a reasonable price. The UK government is accelerating
the construction and commissioning of the VMIC at Harwell and has also
bought a veterinary vaccine manufacturing facility in Essex (Benchmark).
Extra filling capacity has been included in the budget for VMIC leading
to a 20-fold increase in capacity. Such investment is made based on
assumptions about the most likely type of vaccine to be developed. If
the product needs to be frozen, lyophilised, filled into bags etc. the
fill lines may need significant modification.

### Manufacturing Processes

The type of vaccine is very important for determining what route of
manufacture is needed and therefore what type and scale of capacity is
needed
[^93,94](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8776842,2301463&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).
Administration route and storage conditions determine the methods of
fill finish, storage and distribution of the product.

Not all platforms under development, such as RNA vaccines, have a proven
ability to upscale. More traditional formulations are well established
but newer technologies may have a smaller manufacturing footprint and
produce many doses rapidly in bulk. COVID-19 vaccines need to be
manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) in a
registered manufacturing facility
[^94](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=2301463&pre=&suf=&sa=0), at
high volume, rapidly and ideally at low enough cost to allow
affordability and mass immunisation. An overview of the manufacturing
process for different vaccine platforms is shown in Appendix 3.

The two leading vaccine candidates developed in the UK are: (1) the
chimpanzee replication-deficient adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1)
expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and (2) the self-amplifying RNA
(saRNA) vaccine formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The ChAdOx1
vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and commercialised in
collaboration with AstraZeneca is currently in phase 3 clinical trials
[^29](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9598897&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
The saRNA vaccine is developed by Imperial College London and is in
phase 1 clinical trials
[^29](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9598897&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

Besides these two UK-based candidate vaccines, the UK Government also
agreed to acquire vaccines from an additional four suppliers from abroad
[^95](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9598898&pre=&suf=&sa=0),
some of which are planned to be manufactured in the UK, as listed in
**Table 1** below. Thus, in total, the UK Government is planning to
source four different vaccine types, from seven different suppliers
provided that these complete the trials successfully and obtain
regulatory approval. It is worth noting that all of these vaccines
target the Spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2, except for the Valneva vaccine
where the antigen is the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus in its inactivated
state.

**Table 1.** List of COVID-19 vaccines ordered by the UK Government,
subject to clinical success and regulatory approval, listed in the order
of their advancement through clinical trials.

\* The first number indicates the million vaccine doses the UK
Government agreed in principle to purchase, subject to clinical success
and regulatory approval or authorization. When shown, the second number
represents the million doses the UK Government could optionally buy,
subject to clinical success and regulatory approval or authorization.

The adenoviral vector vaccine platform uses cultured mammalian cells to
grow the adenoviral vectors. The RNA platforms utilise a cell-free
enzymatic reaction to synthesise the RNA polymer of the vaccine. This
RNA molecule is then encapsulated into LNPs (small fat droplets) to
prevent degradation and aid the delivery of the RNA into the muscle
cells of the human body. The two recombinant protein subunit vaccines
are viral proteins produced in large quantities in insect cells. The
Novavax vaccine will be formulated using the company’s saponin-based
Matrix-M vaccine adjuvant. The whole viral Valneva vaccine is produced
by culturing the virus in cells and it is then inactivated with
formaldehyde. The downstream purification processes for all of these
vaccine production processes in general consist of a series of
purification and filtration steps. Details of the production processes
for these two vaccine platforms developed in the UK are presented in
Appendix 3.

The ChAdOx1 production amounts range between the equivalent of 1500 –
3500 doses worth of vaccine active ingredient (aka. drug substance) per
L of culture, depending on the production titres, drug substance amount
per dose and losses in the downstream purification. At the 2000 L
bioreactor working volume scale, a single batch takes between 26 and 30
days to complete from the beginning of the upstream process to the end
of the downstream process, and between 100 – 150 million doses of drug
substance can be produced annually at this scale, depending on
production titres, amount per dose and losses in the downstream
purification.

For sa-RNA vaccines, production amounts range between the equivalent of
2 – 3 million doses worth of vaccine active ingredient per L of
bioreaction volume, depending on the production titres, drug substance
amount per dose and losses in the downstream purification. At the 5 L
bioreactor working volume scale, a single batch takes between 40 and 45
hours to complete from the beginning of the upstream process to the end
of the downstream process, and between 5 – 7 billion doses of drug
substance can be produced annually at this scale, depending on
production titres, amount per dose and losses in the downstream
purification.

### Challenges in Manufacture

Overall, the challenges in manufacturing are caused by the urgency and
scale of the demand for a new vaccine for a previously unknown disease.
To address these, rapid-response vaccine production platform
technologies have been deployed as these can in principle meet these
urgent needs. However, these GMP production technologies are relatively
new, and for the RNA vaccine platform there are currently no licensed
products on the market. Thus, these technologies were not fully ready
and validated to address the current pandemic. Furthermore, clinical
trials are not completed thus the final drug substance amount per dose
and number of doses required per patient is not yet known, leading to
uncertainty and potential changes in manufacturing plans. Due to the
pandemic-induced urgency, manufacturers are producing candidate vaccines
for clinical trials and are also (in parallel) scaling up for
commercial-scale production at risk as trials are ongoing without
knowing exactly when and with what outcome trials will complete.

Vaccine supply may be limited by materials or delivery system
costs/availability; simple examples are availability of disposable
bioreactors, cell culture medium, RNA manufacturing components, glass
vials, silicon rubber tubing and syringes and needles. Some vaccines
also need an electroporation device to get the vaccine into cells after
injection. For the RNA platforms, the material costs are the major
contributor to the operating costs and to the overall production costs.
The highest cost material is the 5’ cap analogue, for example the
CleanCap sold by TriLink Biotechnologies, which is required for the RNA
to function in the cells of the human body. All the other production
processes, which are either mammalian or insect cell-based, are carried
out at a much larger scale, commonly at 2000 L bioreactor working
volume. For these cell-based processes, the facility-related costs are
the main contributor. Uncertainty with regards to production amounts,
rates and costs is caused by uncertainty in the drug substance amount
per vaccine dose, production titres, scheduling and production scale.

For the overall vaccine manufacturing process, the bottlenecks could be
the fill-to-finish process whereby the drug substance is filled into
vials or other containers and the so-called drug product is obtained.
Conventional large-scale fill-to-finish technologies can fill up to 400
vials per minute and can operate 60% of the year. Alternative,
fill-to-finish technologies such as blow-fill-seal can provide
additional filling capacity. Filling in larger containers would speed up
the process, and even a 200- and 400-dose IV bag system is developed
which can easily cope with the volume and urgency challenges. However,
filling in such large containers might be limited by the thermostability
of some of the vaccines, such as the RNA vaccines. If RNA and/or other
vaccines need to be lyophilised, this would further slow down and
decrease the production volumes. The ChAdOx1 vaccine is expected to be
filled into multi-dose vials, such as 10-dose vials. Producing for the
UK population seems achievable; however production for meeting the
global COVID-19 vaccination demand is still an enormous challenge. To
meet production targets, single-use technology-based production can be
used and scaled out. In addition, using computational modelling together
with the vaccine manufacturing processes can substantially improve the
performance of these production processes. If the thermostability of the
vaccines could be increased, this would translate to larger productivity
in the fill-to-finish and reduced supply chain and administration
issues.

### Supply chain, distribution and administration

There are a number of risks at present. We cannot predict which vaccine
candidates will be successful and it should be noted that both of the
high profile UK vaccine candidates are based on technology which is
promising but not established.

Global supply will need to be rapidly ramped up as production of any
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will add a need for billions of doses of product that
was not needed previously. We also need to continue other vaccine
manufacture. GSK who are a major vaccine manufacturer currently make
about 3 million doses of vaccine a day. That is about 1 billion doses
per year or about 1/15th of the quantity needed for COVID-19 but not
necessarily available. Similarly, global vaccine capacity for influenza
(in 2009) was 900 million doses
[^69](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9447219&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Substantial components of manufacturing capacity (e.g. - for fill and
finish) can be repurposed across vaccines, but not all manufacturing can
be repurposed. Global coordination of investment in new plants should
ensure the most efficient use of manufacturing capacity
[^93](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8776842&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

The vaccine supply chain consists of: (1) sourcing of raw materials and
consumables used for vaccine drug substance and drug product
manufacturing, and (2) the distribution of the finished product. In both
cases, the supply chain consists of a series of transportation and
storage steps
[^107](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9633254&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
The sourcing of material and consumables as well as the distribution and
administration of vaccines might be disrupted by the pandemic itself if
and when borders are closed, or transportation and travel is restricted,
personnel become ill, raw material or consumable manufacturing
facilities underperform or close down, countries compete for resources
in short supply and the medical system is overwhelmed with treating
patients and cannot allocate enough personnel and resources to vaccinate
the population.

The International Air Transport Association recently reported that 8000
Boeing 747 cargo loads would be needed to distribute a single dose of
vaccine to 7.8 billion people. Frozen vaccines would be more difficult
to transport because of lack of suitable carrying capacity
[^107](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9633254&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
There is currently uncertainty around the thermostability of these
vaccines, especially the newer vaccine types such as the RNA vaccines.
It is possible that RNA vaccines would need to be transported and stored
at -80°C throughout the distribution chain. The distribution of vaccines
at very low temperatures, such as -80°C, is extremely challenging or
even impossible in low and middle income countries with hot and/or humid
weather conditions where road and/or electricity infrastructure is
lacking. For all of these vaccines, manufacturers and researchers are
working towards improving thermostability to reduce the need of the
distribution at very low temperatures.

Finally, using the currently available qualified medical staff for
vaccine injection into patients, the overall bottleneck of the entire
manufacturing-supply-administration chain appears to be the final
administration step. To address this administration challenge,
additional staff will need to be trained (e.g. pharmacists, midwives,
physiotherapists, dentists and vets) to immunise the population rapidly
and safely
[^108](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9598934&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
In principle, vaccination campaigns can also be designed to maximise the
number of individuals vaccinated per medical staff per unit time. All of
the seven vaccines to be acquired by the UK government are administered
intramuscularly; however, these might require two doses in a prime and
boost regimen thus requiring even more medical staff and resources
[^29](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9598897&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

### Advantages of an integrated manufacturing-distribution-administration chain

The vaccine manufacturing-distribution-administration chain represents a
complex system with multiple parts and multiple objectives which are
sometimes competing, such as maximising distribution speeds, maintaining
the stability of the vaccine product, maximising vaccination coverage
and minimising costs. Mathematical optimisation algorithms will be
instrumental in designing and operating such complex systems. By
developing and using such methods, the entire system might be operated
at its maximum potential. In parallel to this, epidemiology modelling
can be used to predict COVID-19 disease spread and minimise COVID-19
related mortalities
[^109](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9598935&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Coupling these two models and using them in real-time with data from the
underlying physical processes, could help combat the current COVID-19
pandemic more effectively in the UK and beyond.

## Lack of access to vaccines may exacerbate health inequalities in the UK and globally 

There are a number of issues that need to be considered around the
impact of COVID-19 vaccine programmes and how they are rolled out on
health inequality
[^110](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9644185&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
These can be split into those that impact health inequalities in the UK
and those that impact health inequalities globally. They can be further
split into those that are direct effects of the vaccine programme versus
those that arise as opportunity costs of the vaccine programme. We
briefly address each in turn.

Given that it is likely that at least in the immediate term the demand
for the vaccine will outstrip supply there will be questions about who
is given priority access. It is important that these questions are
resolved in fair, transparent and accountable ways employing appropriate
processes to do so
[^111](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=1882430&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Thinking first about the various scenarios outlined for vaccine roll out
in the UK it is apparent that there will be different sets of winners
and losers in each scenario. When choosing between scenarios these
winners and losers should be identified for example old versus young,
rich versus poor, white versus ethnic minority. Existing health
inequalities between these groups should be taken into account when
deciding which of the scenarios to pursue in terms of their impacts on
exacerbating or ameliorating existing health inequalities. Clear
criteria should be defined to judge the relative merits of the different
scenarios and clear justification for why a given scenario is chosen
over others should be made explicit
[^112](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=4058990&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
It is important to recognise that vaccines are one element in the
portfolio of tools that can be used to tackle COVID-19. As vaccines
become available the allocation of resources and efforts across
different elements in this portfolio will change. This change in mix of
strategies will give rise to winners and losers.

It is also important to consider the opportunity costs of the vaccine
programme when thinking about impacts on health inequality. A
vaccination programme will use resources that would otherwise have been
used to deliver other services to the population. Thinking about what
services will be displaced, the loss in health arising from this
displacement and identifying the groups that will incur this loss in
health are important considerations from a public health and
inequalities perspective. Some of this displacement will be direct such
as the use of medical supplies (e.g. syringes) that will be used on the
COVID-19 vaccine which might disrupt vaccination programmes for other
diseases. Indirect effects will include the time health care workers
spend on delivering vaccines that would otherwise be used to deliver
other healthcare. Thinking about the impact of this broader displacement
is also valuable to ensure policies that are chosen improve population
health and wellbeing overall and reduce health inequalities.

Other key within-country considerations include the impacts of existing
inequalities in supply of healthcare workforce
[^113](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9644092&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Poorer parts of the population suffer from worse health in the UK and
are currently underserved in terms of access to primary care. If
existing primary care infrastructure is utilised to deliver COVID-19
vaccines this primary care supply inequality may result in reduced
access to the vaccine in poorer areas due to lack of human resources to
deliver the programme in these areas. These implementation issues should
be carefully thought through if health inequalities are not to be
exacerbated by any vaccine programme.

Finally, questions of whether it will be possible to purchase vaccines
privately outside of the programme is also an important consideration.
If wealthier individuals can bypass the chosen national prioritisation
scenario, this will have implications for health inequalities both in
terms of how many vaccines are available in the public sector as well as
in terms of health inequalities arising from the distribution of
vaccines.

There are a number of ways that the UK’s decisions on vaccines can
impact global health inequalities. Some of the most obvious of these
include the fact that any vaccines and associated medical supplies
bought by the UK will not be available for use in other countries.
Competition for vaccines amongst countries may drive prices up globally,
pricing them out of reach of many poorer countries. These impacts may go
beyond COVID-19 vaccines and also impact supplies of key medical
equipment used to deliver these vaccines that are also used in the
delivery of other healthcare. Other considerations are those based
around intellectual property and patents. Strict enforcement of
pharmaceutical licencing backed up by international trade rules such as
TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) have in
the past been seen as restricting access to healthcare from those who
need it most in order to serve the financial interests of the
pharmaceutical industry
[^114](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=1952060&pre=&suf=&sa=0). A
particularly striking recent case study is that of antiretroviral drugs
in South Africa
[^115](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=2781693&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Careful consideration should be given to the issue of access to
healthcare globally when engaging in licensing agreements with vaccine
manufacturers and participating in collective purchasing agreements with
other governments. World Health Organization initiatives to ensure
equitable access for all globally provide valuable opportunities to
collaborate with other countries to promote health equity
[^89](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9644101&pre=&suf=&sa=0).


# Ensuring the success of a vaccination programme: vaccine acceptability 

-   Safety, tolerability, effectiveness and routes of administration may
    influence vaccine acceptability

-   Clear communication is needed to build trust in vaccine benefits to
    maximize acceptability and thus effectiveness

-   Barriers to vaccine uptake need to be minimised

-   Priority groups will often require dedicated focus accounting for
    specific needs and concerns

## Safety, tolerability, effectiveness and routes of administration may influence vaccine acceptability

The first vaccines that are licenced for use against COVID-19 are likely
to significantly influence the public perception and debate. There is a
risk that a vaccine that is poorly effective or reactogenic, or which
requires multiple booster injections will not create an incentive for
uptake among those who perceive themselves at low risk, and if the
vaccine is perceived as having been rushed through safety testing, this
might create long term distrust and hesitancy
[^116],[^117],[^118],[^119](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9416768,8459148,9546262,8773177&pre=&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0,0).

## Clear communication is needed to build trust in vaccines, increase acceptability and thus effectiveness

Vaccines and vaccination programmes need to be trusted to maximise
participation in any national vaccination programme. Clear, transparent
communication can be used to address rational doubts and to enable
informed decision-making. Such communication should include information
on the benefits of any vaccine to individuals and their close contacts
and community; it should not hide the potential limitations of vaccines
including possible limited availability, incomplete protection requiring
boosting and reactogenicity
[^37],[^120],[^121],[^122](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9361547,8802371,7145030,8896765&pre=&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0,0).
While such negative or complicating factors might lower uptake, their
discovery post-rollout is likely to have a far greater negative impact
on uptake. One important aspect of vaccination to be communicated
clearly and early, and involving public dialogue, is how and why groups
will be prioritised for vaccination, so that communities and individuals
are supportive when vaccines are rolled out in a staggered manner.

Effective communication programmes can benefit from using previously
validated approaches. For example, the 3 E’s (Explanation, Engagement
and Education) approach is used by the Bank of England to address the
‘twin deficits’ of public understanding and trust
[^123],[^124],[^125](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9447478,9447510,9447459&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0).
Involving widely trusted individuals with broad reach, such as
healthcare professionals particularly in primary care, can help to
manage expectations and anxieties
[^37](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8896765&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Approaches such as the 3 E’s require a thorough understanding of
communities’ beliefs, values, power structures and behaviours in order
to be effective, as was seen when tackling a polio outbreak in Somali
pastoralist communities in 2013-14
[^126](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=3542195&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

The vaccine hesitancy seen for many non-COVID-19 vaccines is very likely
to also occur for any COVID-19 vaccine
[^127](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9712049&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Some hesitancy is based on rational concerns, which can be addressed
through clear communication and dialogue
[^128](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=1306315&pre=&suf=&sa=0),
however people may have a range of concerns or fears. One framework for
understanding vaccine hesitancy uses two axes: one considering the level
of trust individuals and groups have in health authorities; the other
considering people’s commitment to managing risk in their lives in
general, and their own health in particular
[^129](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=3741925&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Those who take control of their health but distrust authority are likely
to rationalize their hesitancy, while those who do not are more likely
to simply avoid the issue as far as possible. The varied reasons for
vaccine hesitancies will require alternative strategies that meet
individuals where they are. One example of such an approach is ‘convert
communicators’, where those with previously strongly held opinions
explain why they previously held that position and provide new
information that caused them to change their mind
[^130],[^131](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9575881,9575901&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).

## Barriers to vaccine uptake need to be minimised

Smooth supply and availability of vaccination is needed to ensure the
success of a population-wide vaccination strategy. This will require
addressing social and economic disincentives to vaccination, such as the
need to take time off work or secure child care to obtain a vaccine;
such barriers are likely to be greatest for those in society most
vulnerable to COVID-19. This can be achieved through local distribution
involving community workers (not just health workers) where available,
with evening and weekend opening hours. Charging for vaccination, or
withholding vaccines based on citizenship, will lower population-level
vaccine effectiveness and should therefore be avoided. Involving
community leaders in vaccine campaigns is likely to help to maximize
uptake by addressing religious, cultural or other context-specific
concerns about vaccine uptake.

A further step to reducing barriers would be to mandate vaccination as a
prerequisite for resuming activities of various kinds. For example,
vaccination could be mandatory for health care workers to engage in
certain activities as has been used in some settings, for example, with
influenza and hepatitis B vaccination
[^128],[^132](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=1306315,9711286&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).

## Priority groups will often require dedicated focus accounting for specific needs and concerns

Some high-risk groups have particularly high barriers to vaccine uptake.
In general, priority groups are likely to be those at greater risk of
(i) infection; (ii) transmission; or (iii) poor health outcomes.
Maximizing vaccine uptake in those who perceive their risk to be low,
such as young adults, might be enabled by a focus on the benefits of
such vaccination to people they care about who are at greater risk of
poor outcomes – for example, older aged relatives. Ensuring such older
individuals are vaccinated is likely to require different messaging,
perhaps linking COVID-19 vaccine to existing annual influenza shots that
over-65s are routinely offered.

Ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic in the UK in terms of both acquisition and outcome
risk. As scientists work to create a viable vaccine it will become
extremely important for this population to have adequate access and high
uptake. Studies have shown that immunisations in the UK are well
received, but there is evidence that uptake of some immunisations are
lower in Black and Asian minority groups
[^133](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9382775&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Cultural belief differences as well as cultural mistrust are major
obstacles in the implementation of vaccine and immunization promotion
[^134](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=3745641&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
There is a long history of minorities being mistreated by the healthcare
system which reduces their participation. Physician communication
behaviours have been shown to have different effects on patient trust
depending on the race of the patient
[^135](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=6452357&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
While cultural mistrust may deter ethnic minorities from going to their
general practitioner, lack of culturally sensitive communication limits
the public health information they receive. Health guidance
communication only given in English reduces the participation in
immunization among children from ethnic minority backgrounds due to
language barriers
[^134](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=3745641&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Overcoming these barriers will require collaboration with patients and
their families to ensure that ethnic minority populations have access to
vaccinations
[^136](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=6433182&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

# Requirements and consequences of vaccination programmes, possible scenarios

-   Once vaccines have successfully completed clinical trials, decisions
    will need to be made as to the most appropriate vaccination
    strategies

-   Suitability of a vaccine for different strategies will depend on the
    properties of the vaccine itself and its availability

-   Considerations include whether a vaccine prevents disease or
    transmission; efficacy in different recipients; requirements and
    suitability for multiple doses or boosters; affordability;
    constraints in manufacturing capacity and supply; and acceptability.

-   When vaccine supplies are limited, priority could be considered for
    those most at risk of severe disease, health and social care and
    other key workers.

-   The longevity and nature of protection elicited by any vaccine will
    have a significant impact on immunity generated, our ability to
    predict likely waves of infection, the numbers of doses that need to
    be produced and administered (which in turn influence vaccine
    affordability), and feasibility of distribution, public
    acceptability and uptake.

-   Decisions at first will need to be made on limited information

The first generation of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 may be available within
the next 6-18 months. However, these may be suboptimal. Furthermore, a
vaccine may be developed but not available to the UK as a priority.
Decisions on which vaccine strategies to adopt will depend on the
availability of a vaccine, the immunity elicited and acceptability of
the vaccine
[^79],[^137],[^138],[^139],[^140](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9089111,9361602,9656721,9131894,9651311&pre=&pre=&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0,0,0).
Different vaccine strategies will have different results; immunity in
vulnerable populations and those at high risk of exposure, or reduced
transmission or elimination of the infection in the population at large.
The effects of vaccination in different groups such as children,
clinically vulnerable groups and older people must be considered. All
vaccine scenarios discussed below are examples, are not mutually
exclusive and are likely to occur in conjunction with continued
non-pharmaceutical interventions .

Current clinical trials are designed to test efficacy in reducing
clinical disease (symptomatic infection) and the FDA has stipulated a
requirement for 50% efficacy for licensure
[^40](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9644154&pre=&suf=&sa=0);
trials are not necessarily designed to detect protection against
infection, severe disease, transmission, or efficacy in different
groups, although these may be measured as secondary outcomes. A vaccine
with low efficacy will reduce disease burden, but is less likely to be
successful in reaching herd immunity. Further information, for example,
on the longevity of immunity and requirement for boosters, may be
limited at the time when the first vaccines are used. Long term safety
monitoring will be essential.

This will necessitate a flexible approach, in which vaccines are
evaluated as they complete clinical trials, and vaccine strategies
adapted on an ongoing basis. This should be supported by modelling
studies to determine optimal vaccination strategies as information
emerges on vaccine properties and availability
[^138],[^139],[^140](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9656721,9131894,9651311&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0).
As vaccine strategies develop, this will require clear open
communication with the public and health care workers.

</tbody>
</table>

In Scenario 1, vaccines would be administered to those at most risk of
severe disease. This would require fewer doses than a strategy of
widespread vaccination, and is likely to be the optimal strategy when
vaccine supplies are limited
[^65],[^143](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9500788,9717646&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).
Decisions will need to be made as to who should be within the priority
groups for vaccination according to efficacy and availability
[^79],[^137](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9361602,9089111&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).
The UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has issued
interim advice that this could include those over 50 and with other risk
factors, such as chronic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic
pulmonary disease, malignancy, obesity and dementia
[^144](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9366099&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
The WHO initially recommended prioritisation of people over 65, adults
between 30 and 70 suffering from cardiovascular disease, cancer,
diabetes, obesity or chronic respiratory disease, as well as health care
workers
[^137](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9361602&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Priority groups could also include those in the clinically extremely
vulnerable group, who have been shielding, pregnant women and those who
are immunosuppressed
[^144](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9366099&pre=&suf=&sa=0),
but only if the vaccine can be safely used in these groups. The vaccine
should ideally be effective at preventing severe disease in a high
proportion of those in the high-risk groups such as older people, who
often respond poorly to vaccination. Prevention of infection itself and
transmission reduction, although desirable, are not necessary.
Long-lived protection is also a lower priority than under other
scenarios, although a requirement for multiple doses or frequent
boosters will make a vaccination programme more difficult and costly to
implement. In the longer term this will require an ongoing programme of
vaccination of anyone who enters risk groups.

This scenario means that the virus continues to circulate. Not everyone
who is at risk of developing severe disease can currently be identified
based on pre-existing risk factors, leaving some individuals vulnerable.
If the vaccine is only partially protective, protection will be
difficult to confirm in an individual in the absence of clear correlates
of protection.

#### Scenario 2: Vaccination aimed at reducing incidence in those at high risk of infection

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In Scenario 2, the strategy aims to protect those at the highest risk of
infection to reduce the incidence of disease. Those in occupations at
high risk of exposure, particularly health care workers could be
prioritised. Priority might be extended to key workers, such as
emergency services and teachers, and occupations at high risk of
exposure
[^64],[^137](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9501723,9361602&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).
The vaccine does not need to be effective in vulnerable groups, and
protection may not need to be long lived although a requirement for
frequent boosters will be more difficult and costly to implement. The
historically low uptake of vaccines, such as the seasonal influenza
vaccine, and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among health care workers
would need to be addressed if uptake were low
[^146](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=5606975&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
There is precedent for an expectation of vaccination of healthcare
workers in the NHS who are restricted in the procedures they can carry
out if they are not vaccinated against Hepatitis B. The virus will
continue to circulate in the wider population and pose a risk to the
vulnerable.

Transmission to those in high risk groups may be reduced by vaccination
of health and care workers by creating a cocoon which protects the
vulnerable. In our recent report, we estimate that early in the
pandemic, at least 10% (CI 4-15%) of all COVID-19 infections in England
were among these groups, with 6% of infections among care home residents
[^147](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9712218&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Vaccination of care home staff against influenza has been shown to
significantly reduce mortality
[^148](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=1815480&pre=&suf=&sa=0). A
significant proportion of transmission events are likely to occur within
households. Therefore, if transmission is reduced by vaccination, it
might be extended to those who share households with those in vulnerable
groups. 74% of clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) people live with
other people (in the UK), and 15% live in a household with children aged
under 16 years
[^141](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9658058&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
However, it will be difficult to identify and prioritise all contacts of
the vulnerable.

Although most vaccines that prevent disease also prevent transmission of
infection, there is the potential that a vaccinated individual will
still shed virus if infected. The effect of a vaccine on transmission
will not be available following the first trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Vaccines which prevent disease while not reducing viral shedding, or
which do not protect all recipients, could result in inadvertent
transmission, particularly if behaviour changes in those who have been
vaccinated.

</tbody>
</table>

Under Scenario 3, the vaccine is offered to the whole population or
large sectors of the population
[^149],[^150](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=1000723,1461185&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).
A widespread vaccination programme would eventually aim to achieve herd
immunity, in which a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to
prevent sustained transmission of an infection. This strategy would
reduce the incidence of infection overall and thus in addition to
reducing severe disease, would reduce the potential long-term effects of
milder SARS-CoV-2 infection which are still unknown.

For widespread use, the WHO recommends a vaccine product profile of at
least 50% efficacy in the wider population, preferably 70%, with
consistent protection shown in the older people
[^62],[^118](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9500735,9546262&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).
A widespread vaccination policy could substantially reduce disease
burden, even in the absence of herd immunity. A recent model suggested
that, assuming immunity lasts at least one year, over 50% of deaths
could be averted with as little as 35% of the population vaccinated if a
vaccine has more than 50% efficacy
[^65](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9500788&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Once a vaccine is widely available and assuming sufficient vaccine
efficiency, widespread vaccination, particularly of high-transmission
groups may prove to be a more efficient strategy to minimise deaths and
hospitalisations than targeting vulnerable groups
[^65],[^140],[^143](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9500788,9651311,9717646&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0),
however, this is dependent on our ability to identify and prioritise
those driving transmission events, for example, the role of children in
SARS-CoV2 transmission is still unclear
[^151],[^152](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9102939,8989797&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).

To achieve herd immunity, a suitable vaccine must provide sufficient
immunity in those vaccinated to reach an immunity threshold within the
population. Estimates of the proportion of the population that would
need to be immune to achieve herd immunity vary
[^153](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9646130&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Vaccine induced immunity will be in addition to naturally acquired
immunity following infection. For SARS-CoV-2, estimates of R<sub>0</sub>
vary, however (based on 1-1/R<sub>0</sub>) the proportion of the
population that would need to be immune to achieve herd immunity has
been estimated as 50-80%, although herd immunity may be achieved at a
lower rate of immunity, for example if it exists in those more likely to
transmit infection and depending on behaviours
[^139],[^154],[^155](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9131894,8634848,8940477&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0).
A recent model suggested that the epidemic might be constrained if 50%
of the population is vaccinated, in addition to naturally acquired
immunity, if that vaccination is optimally targeted for example to those
most likely to be onwards transmitters; however in reality optimal
strategies are unlikely to be achieved, as those transmitting cannot be
easily identified and selectively prioritised
[^65](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9500788&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

This strategy requires a vaccine to be available in a large number of
doses. The UK government has agreements to secure hundreds of millions
of doses of vaccine from different suppliers (Table 1), however, not all
vaccines currently in trials will prove to be effective or available in
the short term. The longevity of immunity is important to ensure
sufficient levels of immunity can be achieved over the course of a
population wide vaccination programme, although boosters may be required
to maintain immunity. As we discuss earlier in this report, a partially
protective vaccine will require a higher proportion of the population to
be vaccinated to achieve the same levels of immunity. Furthermore, the
response to any vaccine is likely to be heterogeneous. Potentially,
therefore the virus would continue to circulate, as immunity may be
induced in too low a proportion of recipients or be too short lived to
achieve herd immunity, however the extent and frequency of outbreaks
would be expected to decrease
[^63],[^156],[^157](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9516539,733106,9636611&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0).
Even if herd immunity is achieved, outbreaks could still occur for
example, in social groups or geographical regions of low uptake or as
immunity wanes.

Those at low risk of severe disease may have a lower uptake of the
vaccine especially if it is poorly effective, requires boosters or is
reactogenic. Widespread uptake may depend upon a vaccine being perceived
as having a low risk-and-adverse-effects to benefit ratio in those at
low risk of severe disease. Uptake must be encouraged to achieve the
required levels of coverage in those at low risk of severe disease to
protect those who cannot be vaccinated or who respond poorly and are
likely to remain vulnerable to infection or disease. If the vaccine is
partially effective, correlates of protection are unknown and therefore
protection cannot be tested for, widespread vaccination could lead to
increases in risky behaviour in those who assume they are protected
[^118](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9546262&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

Even once high levels of immunity are achieved in the population,
surveillance must be maintained as there is a risk that the virus could
be re-introduced if still circulating globally allowing outbreaks to
occur. Sustained transmission may occur when the number of susceptible
people increases sufficiently, for example, if immunity wanes, if
coverage is uneven and herd immunity is not achieved due to poor uptake,
or in the longer term if mutation of the virus allows it to evade
immunity. Only the eventual goal of global eradication or control will
ensure the low risk of outbreaks in the UK.

#### Scenario 4: Vaccination in response to local outbreaks

</tbody>
</table>

<span id="_jy571i4iqxz5" class="anchor"></span>In Scenario 4, members of
communities are vaccinated in response to outbreaks due to the higher
risk of transmission events in the wider community following a spike in
cases. For example, Hepatitis A vaccination can be employed following
localised outbreaks (158). Scenario 4 might be used once vaccination is
more widespread in a population, if immunity wanes or coverage is low in
certain populations, allowing sustained transmission to occur. The
vaccine itself would ideally prevent both transmission and disease, but
crucially must induce immunity sufficiently rapidly to protect before
the outbreak has spread through the community. The WHO recommends
immunity must be induced in less than 2 weeks and ideally following a
single dose to be suitable to contain outbreaks
[^62](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9500735&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Immunity induced by the vaccine could be short lived if it is sufficient
to contain the outbreak. Sufficient doses would need to be available
locally as part of a rapid response. Success would require continuous
and effective testing and community engagement. Given the short serial
interval of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pre-symptomatic transmission,
attempts to trace and vaccinate only direct contacts and their contacts
(ring vaccination) is unlikely to be effective in containing outbreaks
and immunisation of the wider local community likely to be a more
effective strategy.

# Long term lessons and preparedness

-   Global coordination of vaccine purchase, production and distribution
    is needed

-   Vaccine availability, uptake and effectiveness in different
    populations under different vaccination programmes should be
    monitored

-   Different vaccination strategies should be adopted and reviewed on
    an ongoing basis as data on effectiveness and longevity of immunity
    emerge and new vaccine candidates become available.

-   Long-term safety following widespread use should be carefully
    monitored

-   Viral evasion of vaccine-induced immunity by mutation may require
    modification of vaccines but may be avoided by inclusion of multiple
    targets or conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 in vaccines

-   Public expectations of access to and effectiveness of a vaccine
    should be carefully managed

-   Financial incentives should support development of second generation
    vaccines that are more effective, affordable and acceptable

-   Global collaboration to invest in research, training and
    infrastructure needed for successful vaccine programmes will support
    long term preparedness

## Long-term effectiveness and safety of vaccines in different populations should be monitored

Individuals receiving vaccines will need to be monitored for longevity
of immunity and efficacy in clinically and geographically diverse
populations to establish the overall effectiveness of first generation
vaccines
[^118],[^159](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9546262,9211484&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).
Furthermore, if different vaccines are suitable for use in different
populations or more than one vaccine needs to be used in combination,
this will require coordination of the manufacturing and supply chains.

Post-licensure (phase IV) monitoring will be required to identify
longer-term adverse events, including those that might be associated
with waning of immunity and immunopathology. Rare adverse events or
limited effectiveness in the field may only come to light when very
large numbers of people are vaccinated.

<span id="_w17zo4cc680j" class="anchor"></span>As immunity builds in the
population as a result of naturally-acquired immunity, use of
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, or through vaccination, viruses that
mutate so as to be less well recognised by and evade the immune system
may have a selective advantage and become the dominant strain,
potentially reducing the effectiveness of any vaccine. SARS-CoV-2
mutates less frequently than some other viruses which use RNA as their
genetic code (such as influenza) because coronaviruses possess a genetic
proof-reading mechanism
[^160],[^161],[^162](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=3040680,8550793,9687431&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0).
Changes to the genetic code of a virus can come with a fitness cost, for
example, in terms of ability to replicate and transmit, and therefore
immunity within the population must be above a certain threshold to
drive selection of otherwise detrimental mutants
[^156](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=733106&pre=&suf=&sa=0). As
not all parts of the virus are able to mutate without detriment to the
virus, if these regions are also the target for vaccine induced
immunity, viral evasion of immunity may not occur. For the moment, there
is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing changes in its genetic code
that will significantly change its recognition by immunological memory
responses induced by current vaccine candidates
[^162](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9687431&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
However, other CoVs show substantial genetic variability
[^163],[^164](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8819266,8560499&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).
Studies that use pseudovirus in culture have shown the potential for
loss of recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by antibody
following mutation, although this was prevented if antibody recognising
more than one part of the spike protein was present
[^165](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9328758&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Vaccines that induce immune responses to multiple parts of the spike
protein or vaccines containing more than one viral component may protect
against variants of the virus. Vaccine manufacturers will need to be
able to respond to the discovery of any temporal or geographical
variation in circulating virus and rapidly reformulate better matched
vaccines if this becomes necessary.

## A coordinated global vaccination programme and support for development of second-generation vaccines is needed

It is in the long term interests of sustaining international travel and
trade that efforts to contain COVID-19 are made on a global scale.
Cooperation between nations to invest in vaccine development,
manufacture and purchase will increase the chances of successful
development and availability. Furthermore, allocation of vaccine doses,
once available, to all nations collaboratively is likely to save more
lives than unequal allocation of the same number of doses to a limited
number of nations
[^91],[^143](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9666209,9717646&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0).

If the first vaccines developed are sub-optimal, second generation
vaccines will be needed which are more effective, cheaper, give
longer-lasting immunity and/or are more acceptable (in terms of
reactogenicity/routes of administration) and therefore more suitable for
widespread use. The development of multiple vaccine candidates increases
the likelihood of availability of vaccines with potentially different
characteristics. This will be particularly important while information
is lacking on how long protection following vaccination lasts.

Investment in and deployment of the initial vaccines may mean that the
development of second generation vaccines is delayed or disincentivised.
Until correlates of protection are identified and the level of effective
immunity clearly established, large studies will be needed for every new
vaccine to prove superiority of protection in the wider population. This
will add to the costs and difficulties of developing next generation
vaccines, particularly if disease incidence has been reduced to the
levels where very large population studies (of the order of tens or
hundreds of thousands of participants) would be needed to prove
efficacy.

The race today is to make a vaccine, any vaccine with cost not being a
major consideration. However as time progresses governments will want a
cost effective vaccine. To date Moderna are thought to be targeting $50
to $60 per course ($25 to $30 per dose), Biontec/Pfizer $19.50 per dose
and AstraZeneca a few dollars per dose
[^166](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9715734&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
To use the Moderna vaccine for one cycle of vaccinations in the UK would
cost about $3.4-4 billion just for the vaccine. Even a few dollars a
dose will be out of reach for much of the world's population. As the
memories of the economic cost of our recent shutdowns recede there will
also be significant pressure to reduce annual re-vaccination costs if
they are necessary so a second round of more cost effective vaccines may
be needed. In LMIC the ability of the vaccine to be integrated into
existing vaccination programmes and infrastructure will determine its
affordability
[^76](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9500068&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

Sustained funding will ensure that no one vaccine company develops a
monopoly and will maintain an incentive for market entry of new
vaccines. Such sustained investment will require political will and
global collaboration. International collaboration whereby each country
has a share in many vaccine candidates will reduce the risk to
individual countries that the vaccines they invest in will fail. Lack of
monopoly and negotiation for purchase of supplies at a lower price will
ensure global affordability and distribution of a vaccine. Globally
coordinated upscaling of manufacturing will insure sufficient capacity,
reduce the likelihood of ‘vaccine nationalism’ and help to ensure
availability of affordable global vaccine supplies, thus reducing the
likelihood of future global outbreaks.

## Investment in vaccine R&D, global organisation and public perceptions of vaccination will aid pandemic preparedness, UK plc and support global health in the long term

Following the Ebola virus outbreak, global calls for an international
fund for vaccine development led to the establishment of the Coalition
for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI), formally launched in
2017, with the remit of developing vaccines for priority pathogens and
improving preparedness for outbreaks of infectious diseases
[^167],[^168],[^169],[^170](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8573414,9466033,4153741,1281737&pre=&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0,0).
In the long term, sustained global collaboration will ensure we are
capable of responding to future outbreaks as part of an integrated
international pandemic response, but investment is also needed in local
health care provision and community engagement
[^171](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=1297318&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Lessons must now be learned from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in order to
prepare for the risks of future outbreaks.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines have come under scrutiny as never
before. Public perceptions of the safety and effectiveness of
vaccination will be shaped by the success or otherwise of the
development and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programmes.
Premature licensure and implementation of a vaccine programme is likely
to negatively affect public perceptions and subsequent uptake of future
vaccines, if the vaccine proves ineffective or to have substantial
side-effects. On the other hand, a successful programme offers an
opportunity to increase public engagement with vaccination more widely.

The UK response to the current pandemic has proven its place as a global
leader in the development of vaccine technology. Investment can be made
at a national level and new funding instruments such as advanced market
commitments could be used to incentivise investment in vaccine
development and manufacturing facilities via international
organisations.

In the long term, both ‘push’ and ‘pull’ financial instruments will be
needed to maximise the likelihood and expedite the success of vaccine
programmes. A criticism of push funding, which invests in basic research
and development costs ex-ante, is that there is a risk of investing in
candidates and research with a poor chance of success, with the risk of
failure taken entirely by the funder. Furthermore, it does not
incentivise speed and efficiency of research. Pull funding can be used
to reward both the development of the final product, and for achieving
innovation, goals or milestones relating to health
[^73](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9530979&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

To deploy vaccines faster for future outbreaks, the clinical trials and
the regulatory approval process should be further accelerated, and surge
vaccine manufacturing capacity should be maintained. Completing clinical
trials and gaining regulatory approval is a major bottleneck as this
currently is estimated to take around 12-18 months, even with
fast-tracking. This can in principle be further accelerated by
complementing a vaccine manufacturing platform, such as the RNA
platforms, with a Quality by Design (QbD) modelling framework which
incorporates disease-agnostic prior knowledge. This could in principle
serve as a “pre-qualification” to speed up clinical trials and the
regulatory approval process, also in case of a new outbreak caused by a
new pathogen
[^172](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9606951&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Maintaining surge vaccine manufacturing capacity is also crucial for
rapid-response vaccine production. This would be comparatively easily
achieved for the saRNA platform as it can produce high vaccine volumes,
rapidly at a small production scale in small facilities, that can also
operate on single-use production equipment, thus would be financially
low cost to maintain. These facilities, when there is no outbreak,
instead of being idle, could also produce other high-demand vaccines or
vaccine candidates for clinical trials. Switching between vaccines
against different diseases would be relatively straight-forward when
single-use production equipment is used.

The investment and scientific innovations that have been made in
vaccines during the pandemic will benefit the development of future
vaccines. For example, there is a pressing need for the development of a
universal influenza or coronavirus vaccine that will protect against
emerging pandemic strains. Sustained investment in basic science and
novel vaccine platforms will shorten future development times for novel
vaccines. For example, rapid sharing of the genetic code of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus and its use to develop novel vaccines occurred in
record speed, due to the technologies developed as a result of
investment in basic science
[^173](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=3671022&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
We need a better understanding of the transmission, disease mechanisms
and immune response to infections, and investment in the development of
effective vaccine technologies, particularly in the light of an aging
global population. Continued investment should support the training and
careers of personnel with expertise as well as infrastructure, in the
following areas
[^171],[^174],[^175],[^176],[^177](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=4633079,1297318,9469017,7216189,9468391&pre=&pre=&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0,0,0);

# Appendices

## Appendix 1 Human challenge studies

### Background

Several experts in epidemiology, immunology, public health and bioethics
have argued or proposed that controlled human challenge trials of
candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines be seriously considered. In brief, a human
challenge trial of a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would involve the
intentional infection of a small number of healthy volunteers with
SARS-CoV-2; some of these volunteers would have received the vaccine,
and some would have received a placebo. Eyal, Lipsitch and Smith
[^57](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8596169&pre=&suf=&sa=0)
were among the first to argue that such human challenge studies could,
through bypassing conventional Phase 3 trials of candidate vaccines,
subtract many months from the licensing process, making effective
vaccines available much more quickly. Jamrozik and Selgelid
[^58](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8984878&pre=&suf=&sa=0)
argue that, in addition to this, human challenge studies could enable
the rapid and accurate comparison of several candidate vaccines,
simultaneously, whereas attempting this in Phase 3 trials would
‘plausibly require tens of thousands of participants, and take many
months or years to complete’. As these papers point out, there are also
important risks to consider, in human challenge studies: for example,
the direct health-risk to participants (which should be minimized by
restricting volunteers to healthy young adults), the risk of undermining
public confidence in vaccines (in the event of untoward effects of the
human challenge studies), and the risk of infection of third parties
such as researchers (which should be minimized by protective measures).

On 6th May, the World Health Organization published a report
[^181](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9657539&pre=&suf=&sa=0)
conditionally backing human challenge trials of candidate COVID-19
vaccines, subject to certain criteria being met. The report states the
following:

‘Challenge studies might be particularly likely to accelerate the
availability of vaccines where there is appropriate coordination between
researchers, manufacturers and regulators. In any case, such studies
should be incorporated into wider research programmes involving larger
studies to provide more precise estimates of safety and efficacy
(potentially including adaptive trial designs if appropriate).
SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies could add value to other types of vaccine
research by enabling (a) accurate assessment of asymptomatic infection,
(b) more rapid and standardized testing of multiple vaccine candidates,
and (c) testing vaccines in contexts where there is little continuing
transmission (for example, due to public health measures or during
inter-epidemic periods).

Although more data will help to clarify relevant risks, current
estimates suggest that participation in SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies
would be least risky for young healthy adults. In those aged 18–30 years
(whether healthy or not), hospitalization rates for COVID-19 are
currently estimated to be around 1% and fatal infection rates around
0.03%. Other long-term health outcomes in this age group are as yet
poorly understood. As required by the criteria below, SARS-CoV-2
challenge studies should be conducted in specialized facilities, with
especially close monitoring and ready access to early supportive
treatment for participants, including critical care if required.
However, SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies may (at present) be thought to
involve higher levels of risk and uncertainty than other commonly
accepted human challenge studies because the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is
still poorly understood, the efficacy of the antiviral treatment
remdesivir in stopping viral replication still unclear (although it has
been shown to shorten hospital stay), and the small but present risk of
severe disease or death in young adults. Global public trust in clinical
research and vaccines depends on there being heightened vigilance to
ensure that, if they proceed, SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies are conducted
to the highest scientific and ethical standards. Eight ethical criteria
for conducting SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies are set out in Table 1:

**Table 1:** Eight criteria for SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies
<table><tr><td>
Criterion 1: SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies must have strong scientific
justification.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Criterion 2: It must be reasonable to expect that the potential benefits
of SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies outweigh risks.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Criterion 3: SARS-CoV-2 challenge research programmes should be informed
by consultation and engagement with the public as well as relevant
experts and policy-makers.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Criterion 4: SARS-CoV-2 challenge study research programmes should
involve close coordination between researchers, funders, policy-makers
and regulators.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Criterion 5: SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies should be situated where the
research can be conducted to the highest scientific, clinical and
ethical standards.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Criterion 6: SARS-CoV-2 challenge study researchers should ensure that
participant selection criteria limit and minimize risk.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Criterion 7: SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies should be reviewed by a
specialized independent committee.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Criterion 8: SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies must involve rigorous informed
consent.
</td></tr></table>

We remark that it remains the case, to our knowledge, that there is no
(statistically significant) evidence that remdesivir reduces the risk of
death among COVID-19 patients, though there is some evidence that it
shortens recovery time for severely ill patients (by a median of
approximately four days), see
[^182](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8943399&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
Since the above W.H.O. report was published, somewhat more effective
treatments than remdesivir have been found. In particular, the
corticosteroid dexamethasone has been shown (by a large Oxford
University study,
[^183](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9298578&pre=&suf=&sa=0) to
reduce the death-rate of seriously ill COVID-19 patients on ventilators,
by approximately one third; the clinical use of the corticosteroids
dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, for patients with severe or critical
COVID-19 illness, was subsequently recommended by the W.H.O. on 2nd
September, and received MHRA approval on 3rd September. These remain the
most effective treatments to have been approved for widespread use. Of
course, better treatments may well become available in the near to
medium term. As of 1st September, the European Medicines Agency was in
discussion with the developers of 158 experimental treatments, including
immunomodulators, antivirals and hyperimmune serums.

We give below a summary of the benefits, risks, disadvantages and
ethical problems of human challenge trials of candidate vaccines for
SARS-CoV-2, and possible ways of mitigating these
risks/disadvantages/problems, following the papers and reports cited
above.

### Benefits

-   Human challenge studies could, through bypassing conventional Phase
    3 trials of candidate vaccines, subtract many months from the
    licensing process, making effective vaccines available much more
    quickly, and thus reducing the total number of deaths (and cases of
    severe illness) caused by COVID-19, by many thousands, worldwide.

-   They could enable the rapid and accurate comparison of several
    candidate vaccines, simultaneously.

### Risks, disadvantages, and ethical problems

-   The direct health-risk to volunteers who develop COVID-19 illness
    (viz., the risk of death or severe illness) as a result of the human
    challenge trials - in the absence of a highly effective treatment.
    (We recall that the most effective available treatments, namely
    corticosteroids, still only reduce the risk of death by
    approximately one-third.)

-   The infection-risk to third parties (e.g. researchers) during the
    trials.

-   The risk that public confidence in vaccines may be undermined in the
    event of untoward effects of challenge studies, possibly reducing
    public uptake of vaccines in the future.

-   Restricting human challenge trials of a vaccine to young, healthy
    individuals will not provide information on the level of protection
    it would give to older/elderly individuals, who are more at risk of
    severe illness or death, if infected. (Though this disadvantage
    should be weighed against the fact that vaccines which reduce
    transmission among younger members of a population, would still have
    utility in reducing overall transmission.)

-   Human challenge trials are typically small-scale (up to 100
    individuals), whereas, to assess potential side-effects of a
    candidate vaccine, a much larger trial would also be required. (Such
    a trial, however, would not require any of the individuals involved
    being exposed to the virus, and would therefore avoid many of the
    problems of Phase 3 trials.)

### Possible measures for mitigating these risks and ethical problems

-   The restriction of human challenge trials to healthy volunteers
    between the ages of 18 and 30, who are able to give fully-informed
    consent.

-   Provision of comprehensive information on the risks, to potential
    volunteers.

-   Continuous monitoring of volunteers, and timely access to
    state-of-the-art facilities and treatment in the event that they
    develop Covid-19 illness.

-   Recruiting volunteers from populations who are naturally exposed to
    a higher level of risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, than others
    (e.g., due to living in a country, or working in a sector,
    experiencing a high infection incidence rate).

-   Protective measures to minimise the risk of infection to third
    parties.

-   Extensive public consultation before human challenge studies are
    allowed to commence.

There remain differences of opinion among experts, as to whether human
challenge studies of candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are ethically
justified. To cite two high-profile examples, Nir Eyal, Director of
Rutgers University’s Centre for Population-Level Bioethics, has argued
forcefully in favour
[^181](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9657539&pre=&suf=&sa=0),
whereas Eleanor Riley, formerly Director of the Roslin Institute and
Professor of Immunology at Edinburgh University, has argued strongly
against
[^184](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9657541&pre=&suf=&sa=0).
These differences of opinion partly hinge on whether the level of risk
(of severe illness, or death) to participants is within acceptable
limits. Some researchers (such as Eyal, see
[^181](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9657539&pre=&suf=&sa=0);
see also
[^185](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=9657587&pre=&suf=&sa=0))
have proposed that risks of organ donation be used for comparison. (It
appears that the risk of death to a healthy young adult, when infected
with SARS-CoV-2, is similar in magnitude to the risk of dying when
donating a kidney.) However, others have pointed out that the
equivalence between these scenarios is imperfect, as the benefits of
organ donation accrue to an individual close to the donor, whereas the
benefits of human challenge trials accrue (in expectation) to the
population at large, and furthermore are not guaranteed (as the trial
may fail). Some researchers (such as Jamrozik and Selgelid
[^58](http://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=8984878&pre=&suf=&sa=0))
have proposed that the background risk (to certain vulnerable
populations, e.g. healthcare workers in certain countries) be used for
comparison, but (as Jamrozik and Selgelid concede), the objection can be
made that high levels of background risk may be caused by injustices or
institutional failures (such as a lack of protective equipment).

### Questions for further study

Addressing ‘Criterion 2’ in the W.H.O. report, as to whether it is
reasonable to expect that the potential benefits of SARS-CoV-2 challenge
studies outweigh the risks, would involve making certain assumptions on
the likelihood of an effective vaccine being thus developed/accelerated,
and the level of protection likely to be provided by such a vaccine to
different age-groups, as well as making certain assumptions on how
infection incidence will change in different countries, in the medium
term. (The latter will, in turn, affect the feasibility, duration and
resource requirements of relying solely upon conventional Phase 3
vaccine trials.) Different candidate vaccines are likely to have
different risk/benefit trade-offs. For example, the utility of human
challenge trials for a candidate vaccine designed to prevent disease
(and not transmission), is likely to be less than for others, since the
older individuals are much more at risk than younger individuals of poor
disease outcomes, immune responses to vaccines can reduce markedly with
increasing age, and challenge trials would involve only younger
individuals. Nevertheless, we recommend that regulators consider these
questions preemptively; amongst other things, this will enable timely
implementation of human challenge trials, should Phase 3 trials become
infeasible.

To help regulatory authorities to properly address the question of
whether human challenge trials of candidate COVID-19 vaccines are
ethically justified, we propose the following questions.

-   Given current prevalence estimates (and predictions of medium-term
    prevalence), what is the feasibility of testing candidate vaccines
    in conventional Phase 3 trials (both in the UK, and in countries
    with higher levels of prevalence), and if Phase 3 trials are
    feasible, how long are they likely to take compared to challenge
    trials, and what are their resource requirements and potential
    negative effects?

-   What are the ethical and geopolitical problems of conducting Phase 3
    trials in (poorer) countries with high infection-rates, and how can
    such problems be mitigated, e.g. through compensation?

-   What are the medium-term and long-term effects of moderate illness
    and severe illness on recovered patients? (This will of course
    require data from longitudinal studies of patients who suffered
    moderate and severe illness.)

-   What would be the impact on public support for vaccination
    programmes, of significant adverse effects on volunteers? (This
    issue is raised in the extract from the W.H.O. report, above.)
    Surveys could be designed to help to gauge this.

-   What are the ethically justified ways of reducing the level of risk
    to each individual volunteer?

-   What are the expected costs of financial compensation for volunteers
    who suffer long-term effects from exposure? What would be the
    advantages and disadvantages of promising such compensation
    explicitly, ahead of the tests? For example, is it likely that it
    would encourage, or discourage, participation?

-   What would be the costs of insurance against untoward events
    occurring during the trials? (We note that, even if compensation in
    the event of long-term effects is not promised ahead of time, it
    would still be necessary to insure against compensation claims.
    Moreover, in studies conducted within the NHS/NIHR, participants are
    entitled to use the NHS complaints processes, so claims could arise
    irrespective of what compensation, if any, is promised.)

## Appendix 3 Vaccine production 

### Production of the ChAdOx1 vaccine

The ChAdOx1 production process starts with preparing the HEK293 cell
seed train and the adenovirus inoculum seed train. For this, the HEK293
cells are cultured at increasing volumes until the amounts required for
the production bioreactor (commonly at 2000 L working volume) scale are
obtained. In the production bioreactor the HEK293 cells are first
cultured to reach the required cell densities and then these cells in
which the adenovirus can replicate are infected to produce the
adenovirus. This adenovirus has been genetically modified to express the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and it cannot replicate in human cells, thus it
is a vector for delivering the genetic material to express the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The cell culture and virus production in the
bioreactor takes around 7-10 days and it can be operated in fed-batch
mode. From the bioreactor, the solution enters the downstream separation
and purification section of the process whereby cells are initially
lysed then the larger impurities (such as cell debris) are removed using
microfiltration where the adenoviral vectors flow through the filter.
Next, another particle size-based separation is performed, where the
tangential flow ultrafiltration/diafiltration is performed to retain
adenoviruses by the filter. Here the adenoviruses are washed, and the
buffer is replaced with a buffer suitable for the subsequent
ion-exchange chromatography step. In the ion-exchange chromatography
step the adenoviral vectors are separated based on electrical charge
differences that exist between these adenoviral vectors and other
impurities. Following elution from the ion-exchange chromatography, the
adenoviral vector solution is sterile filtered, and the buffer can be
exchanged for the formulation buffer, using tangential flow
ultrafiltration/diafiltration.

### Production of self-amplifying RNA vaccines

For saRNA vaccine production the process starts with a cell-free
enzymatic reaction, whereby the saRNA molecule is synthesized using the
T7 RNA polymerase enzyme based on a DNA template. The saRNA synthesis,
(aka. *in vitro* transcription) reaction takes 2 hours and then the DNA
template is digested using the DNAse I enzyme in 15 minutes and then the
solution enters the downstream purification section. This reaction mix
has a well-defined and simple composition compared to cell-based culture
broths, thus the downstream purification is also relatively simple.
Downstream purification can consist of tangential flow filtration,
whereby the saRNA which is the largest size component is retained by the
filter and the other smaller size components flow through the filter.
Next, the saRNA can be further purified using CaptoCore 700 multi-modal
chromatography. After this the buffer is exchanged for the formulation
buffer using tangential flow ultrafiltration/diafiltration. Next,
formulation in LNPs takes place, which is the longest duration
operation, taking around 9-10 hours to complete. The formulation
commonly takes place at the drug substance manufacturing site, to
stabilise the RNA molecule. Following formulation, the solution is
sterile filtered and can be shipped to the fill-to-finish site.
