abstract: |
  The coming months will bring new challenges for the economy and
  public health, as winter brings with it the risk of a second wave of
  infections and, over the longer term, changing patterns of local and
  national lockdowns become a ‘new normal’. Tackling these
  challenges will require targeted policies that are sensitive both
  to the spread of the disease and the economic costs of different
  interventions.

  To help policymakers tackle these challenges we have drawn on
  insights from recent economic work into the pandemic that transcends
  the crude ‘health versus the economy’ dichotomy that indiscriminate
  lockdown measures tend to invoke, and instead seeks to explore more
  targeted interventions that have the potential to *alleviate* the
  trade-off between lives and livelihoods, attaining more desirable
  outcomes in both dimensions. We suggest methodologies including how
  economic models can incorporate insights from epidemiology; we
  review evidence about pandemic economic impacts; we suggest tools
  and methods that will be useful in monitoring the economy as it
  attempts to recover; and we suggest data required for conducting
  economic analysis. <!--break-->

  By combining economic and epidemiological data to model different
  scenarios, policymakers can seek to tailor interventions to sectors
  and firms in ways that help to mitigate the risks of both a second
  peak and the looming prospect of a double dip recession. These
  ‘smart’ non-pharmaceutical interventions would recognise that
  sectors, firms and individuals are interlinked, with measures taken
  in one sector likely to affect other parts of the economy; that fear
  of contracting the virus – or uncertainty about how to manage it –
  are strong drivers of economic behaviour, meaning continuing anxiety
  will likely affect consumer confidence; that the prospects for an
  effective vaccine are uncertain; and that the extent to which
  infection leads to immunity remains poorly understood, creating a
  need for non-pharmaceutical interventions that may need to persist
  long-term. They may include:

  -   Workplace rotation schemes: Rotations or split shifts have an
      exponential impact on infection rates, for example having just
      two cohorts or rotations within a workplace.

  -   Subsidised workplace testing: Test-Track-Isolate (TTI) could help
      identify and control workplace outbreaks quickly, particularly in
      key sectors and those occupations in which ‘high-contact’ is a
      feature.

  -   Flexible furloughing: A more flexible furlough scheme could help
      to open up the labour market and incentivise business investment
      in new home-working technologies. With the possibility of
      continued economic disruption in 2021 and beyond, there is a
      need to develop effective job-creation schemes in occupations
      and firms that can adapt to these new circumstances.

  -   Sick pay: Current sick pay arrangements create a financial
      disincentive to self-isolate, with half of workers continuing to
      work through mild coronavirus symptoms, which in turn makes it
      more difficult to control transmission. Reviewing statutory sick
      pay could help incentivise those with symptoms to self-isolate.

  -   Reopening schools: Schools can prepare for potential future
      resurgence of the epidemic with rotation schemes and better
      online provision for teaching and examinations.

  -   Capitalising on government commitments to net zero and
      addressing regional inequalities: The government before the
      crisis had committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to
      ‘level up’ the economy. A recovery plan could seek to progress
      these agendas. For example, promoting employment schemes
      supported by training programs in clean energy sectors and home
      insulation can aid in reducing carbon emissions.

  -   Unemployment support: As the furlough scheme unwinds, it may
      be beneficial to review the design of unemployment support
      systems and schemes designed to help individuals back into
      work.

  Such interventions must be carefully designed to account for the
  uneven distribution of the economic effects of the pandemic, as
  there are already indicators that impact of the pandemic on
  household finances and job prospects have been regressive. There is
  evidence to suggest that women have been harder hit economically by
  the pandemic and have picked up a higher proportion of extra caring
  responsibilities. Richer households have seen greater falls in
  consumption, and increases in savings, while lower-earning
  households have increased their borrowing to fund essential
  spending. Low-earning workers are also in jobs that tend to be
  harder to perform remotely, increasing their risk of unemployment or
  infection in the workplace, if mitigating steps are not taken.

  Designing sound policy – and effectively tailoring it to ensure
  maximum impact – requires access to high-quality data. Those
  developing and monitoring the implementation of economic
  interventions would benefit from access to a range of different data
  types, including data relating to transmission of COVID-19, use of
  public transport, consumer spending and financial transactions. Many
  useful indicators of the economy’s response to COVID-10 could be
  found in data typically held by private financial institutions and
  are generally considered to have commercial value. While some
  progress has been made in making such data available, the UK lags
  behind its European counterparts in its ability to mobilise this
  data to develop policy responses, and action is needed by government
  to ensure fine-grained financial data is made available for such
  analysis.

  This report illustrates some of the important economic issues that
  have arisen during the COVID-19 crisis in the UK. The complexity and
  changeability and the current economic environment mean the report
  is by necessity incomplete in its representation of the literature;
  it instead synthesises insights from four key areas that will be
  central to developing policy responses. First, it considers how
  economic models need to take into account insights from
  epidemiology, if these are to provide useful policy
  insights. Second, it reviews evidence about the impact of COVID-19
  on the economy. Third, it explores the tools and methods that will
  be useful in monitoring the economy over the coming months as
  recovery is attempted from the economic shock caused by the
  pandemic. Fourth, it considers the data needed for conducting
  economic analysis, calling for further access to data in key areas.

# Key Conclusions

A tight lockdown that is released too quickly or too fully would
probably lead to adverse outcomes in terms of *both* lives and
livelihoods. To be precise, too quickly or too fully here means relaxing
the lockdown without sufficient regard for the state of the pandemic,
the capacity of the health care system, and epidemiological markers such
as the effective reproduction number. The rationale is simple: an abrupt
and premature lockdown exit would lead to a second wave of infections
that would bring with it both a higher death toll and additional costs
for the economy. Through the lens of integrated macroeconomic and
epidemiological models, there are other policy options that are probably
preferable to an abrupt lockdown exit, for example coupling such a
cautious lockdown exit strategy with other targeted approaches, such as
work rotation, and TTI schemes.

Policy needs to be flexible enough to adjust to uncertainties, in
particular, about the future evolution of the epidemic. In the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic, smart policy in many cases should be dependent
on the state of the epidemic and the economy and, in particular, change
if epidemic and economic markers cross certain thresholds. For example,
labour market strategy should be sensitive to the persistence of the
crisis and the likelihood of further waves of infection. Further action
is also needed to ensure that policy responses account for the
regressive impact of the pandemic on household finances and job
prospects, and the distributional implications of different approaches
to managing the pandemic.

Data access will be vital to developing policy responses. The UK
government and supporting bodies should continue pursuing the goal of
obtaining more and more representative and fine-grained transactions
data from UK financial institutions for the purpose of monitoring the
impact of COVID-19 and associated policy interventions. Such data are
valuable assets in the current situation, and the UK should be the
vanguard in efforts to harness its power for effective and timely
policymaking.

Models for studying the impact of pandemics need to recognise that
measures taken in one sector affect other parts of the economy as
sectors of the economy and firms within a sector are interlinked. Not
recognising these risks gives a misleading picture of the economic costs
of restricting some kinds of economic activities. For example, extreme
lockdowns have severe economic consequences for non-essential sectors,
such as hospitality, sports, and leisure, which are also large
employment sectors.

Given the nature of supply chains spanning the entire world, the
effectiveness of the existing UK strategy will depend on the policies
that other countries implement, in particular, those that are tightly
connected to UK in the production process and consumption. The current
crisis has brought to the forefront the need to monitor and design
supply chains that are responsive to shocks, for example by
understanding which firms are essential for meeting demand of key goods
and services in a crisis. Answers to these questions require
substantially more granular data.

Any economic analysis rests on the assumptions that we make about the
properties of the disease. Thus, any policy prescriptions must also be
understood in the context of what we currently know about the basic
immunological facts of COVID-19 and that are sensitive to the duration
of the shock and to the evolving understanding of the nature of acquired
immunity. Policies should ideally be able to adjust to uncertainties and
work whether immunity is acquired indefinitely or is temporary. As new
understandings of the continuing effects of COVID-19 infection emerge,
policy responses may also need to be adjusted take into account the
impact of the virus on the long-term health of individuals.


# Introduction

## The Economic Impact of the Pandemic on Households and Firms

There are many ways of tracking the economic impact of the pandemic:

-   At a household level, there are impacts on consumption and
    earnings. In analysing these, it is important not to neglect
    within-household changes with shifts in caring responsibilities
    across parents.

-   The behaviour of firms, which make key decisions on employment and
    investment, is also important. This will be affected by a number of
    different factors, including:

    -   Following the crisis, space management will become a
        particular challenge as will be new concerns around workplace
        safety, e.g. making sure that workers have appropriate personal
        protective equipment (PPE).

    -   There will be a need for rapid response and outbreak control
        in the event of a cluster–leading to shut down of individual
        businesses in some cases.

    -   The abrupt changes in revenues have necessitated rescheduling
        of obligations such as paying taxes and rent. But many firms
        will also have resorted to taking out loans (many of them
        guaranteed by the UK government) which will, in time, have to be
        paid off, rescheduled, or forgiven.

Some of these adjustments by firms and households require fundamental
behavioural changes against a backdrop of high levels of uncertainty
about the magnitude and duration of the disruption that they face. Just
what will become the “new normal” for the economy is far from clear.
Those who operate in the market economy will see a range of wage and
price adjustments; many more workers will probably be asked to take pay
cuts and some prices will have to increase to fund the additional costs
of doing business. Supply chains and production networks create an
interdependent process where changes in one part of the economy
influence others. Some sectors of the economy are more dependent on
public funding and regulated pricing. Some pre-crisis business models
will no longer be viable, as we have seen in public transport, which
will require either changes in frequency, fares, or public funding.

How all of this plays out will determine the size and duration of the
economic adjustments needed. The whole adjustment process, whether in
markets or the public sector, will be greatly affected by government
policy, both directly and indirectly.

## Uncertainties, Behaviour, and Inequalities

Understanding the impact of the crisis on the economy requires
analysing the incentives and disincentives that firms and households
face. Some of these are material incentives due to changes in financial
costs and benefits from different actions, but non-material
considerations are crucial too with psychological costs due to the fear
of infection.

Developing such understanding of individual responses is challenging.
How far people are able to make consistent judgements in such
circumstances is an open question and the behavioural economics
literature has identified a range of behavioural “biases” that can
inform an individual’s response. An important issue is also how far
economic responses are best captured by assuming that they are based on
self-interest. Physical distancing and mask-wearing/face-covering are
partly protective to the individual taking the action, but also
pro-social. A range of existing studies in economics have found
predictors of pro-social behaviour (such as education) that are likely
to be relevant. That said, the impact on psychology and non-material
factors is often much more difficult to assess, especially when the
context is novel and full of uncertainties. For example, the kind of
people who answer economics survey questions during a pandemic, as well
as their answers, are subject to potential biases, making it hard to
obtain representative and unbiased reports on behaviour.

Restrictions that affect the economy are likely to remain in place for
some time and will be subject to change, sometimes at short notice, in
response to changes in the epidemiology of COVID-19. In aggregate terms,
these restrictions will be manifested in lower Gross Domestic Product
(GDP). But looking at things purely in aggregate terms is limiting. It
is crucial to study who is losing (and in a few cases gaining) from the
crisis. Those in secure employment who can easily adapt to working from
home and have few caring responsibilities are likely to have suffered
least both financially and in terms of their overall well-being. Those
who face the prospect of unemployment, living in cramped conditions, and
have had disruption due to the need to act as carers or educators will
tend to have suffered the most. Changes in aggregate income do not tell
this story. Nor does looking at aggregate income changes tell us about
what is going on–the way in which key decisions are being affected by
the crisis nor how businesses are adapting or changing.

Although the crisis is unique, the main forces that are driving the
economy can be measured using standard features of economic analysis
with the outlook for the economy dependent on forward looking behaviour
of government, consumers, and businesses. The duration and intensity of
the economic effects, particularly those involving investments, will be
affected by confidence in the future. It is critical to understand how
behaviour is changing due to the way in which citizens are experiencing
the crisis and assessing the dangers posed by the progression of the
disease. This affects both the need for policy intervention and the
nature of these interventions.

If consumers believe that they need to save in anticipation of a worse
future, this may reduce consumption and investment today, and can make
such beliefs self-fulfilling. This also depends on what people expect
government to do, in particular, the duration of support measures and
policies to stimulate the recovery. The fact that policy is so uncertain
makes it extremely difficult to forecast the economy at the macro level
and such forecasts need to be interpreted cautiously given extreme
levels of uncertainty. But this matters at the micro level too as those
making economic decisions have their concerns about particular features
of the economy. There is now a large literature in economics that shows
that uncertainty has a significant impact on forward looking behaviour
and that this is particularly important when there are large adjustment
costs such as due to physical distancing measures.

## The Trade-off between Lives and Livelihoods

One of the core questions raised by the crisis is whether and to what
extent there is a trade-off between saving lives and preserving
livelihoods. Figure 1 lays out a concept that has become central to
economic thinking about the crisis, the idea of a *policy frontier,
which* is discussed further below. It embodies three core ideas. First,
different courses of action (for example, how severe the impact of
restrictions in place is on economy activities) give rise to different
paths of progression for the disease and the economy, affecting both
health and economic costs. Second, indiscriminate lockdown measures
likely create a trade-off between the two, with more severe restrictions
being better for public health but worse for economic welfare–though
knowing the precise terms of that trade-off is very difficult given
challenges in measuring and predicting both the economic and
epidemiological consequences of a given policy. Third, more targeted
interventions have the potential to *alleviate* the trade-off between
lives and livelihoods and to *shift out* this policy frontier, thereby
attaining more desirable outcomes in both dimensions.

An emerging field called epi-macro, which combines dynamic models from
epidemiology and macroeconomics to study the joint path of disease and
the economy, is being developed in response to the crisis for exploring
these issues in quantitative models. How far these models will be able
to inform specific policy paths taken by government is still an open
question, but they are already proving important in framing the logic of
trade-offs faced in managing the pandemic. These epi-macro models
require those who are taking decisions to confront the issue of
balancing economic costs and public health benefits. Such models can
also address the distributional implications of different strategies,
particularly those that will affect workers in different sectors of the
economy.

The epi-macro models also focus attention on the search for policies
that can deliver health benefits at low economic costs, such as wearing
face masks/coverings, as well as the importance of avoiding those
policies that could stimulate economic activity but encourage risky
behaviour, such as subsidising eating out. Such models do not give
definitive answers but are important for policymaking.

More controversial is whether economic analysis can also provide a way
of helping to resolve *how* the trade-off between lives and livelihoods
can be made. There is a well-developed economic approach, which has been
influential in the public health systems, that looks at the impact of
treatments in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYS). In parts of
the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has
used such methods of evaluation before the crisis to decide on whether
to support a particular health treatment or certain drugs. We discuss
pros and cons of using this approach in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic below and report on some recent analysis that has tried to
quantify the trade-off between loss of income and lives lost. When
conducting such analyses, it is important to keep in mind that much of
the economic cost may not be attributable to the policy. There is also
no attempt to look at the distributional effects across any dimensions
such as old versus young or across different regions. How large are the
long-term impacts on physical and mental health is also an issue,
although they would tend to suggest, if anything, that looking at short
term QALYs is an underestimate of the true societal cost.

## The Way Forward

#### Policymakers must plan responses that manage the impact of COVID-19 on the economy over the longer term

When designing policy, it is important to have a realistic expectation
for the future. The virus is likely to become endemic, and to recur in
spikes, which may be either sporadic, seasonal (winter), or both, and it
is still uncertain whether and when an effective vaccine will be made.
Even if a vaccine is effective, it may need to be re-administered at
intervals of 1 to 3 years, to boost waning immunity. And there will be
significant logistical challenges and possibly political challenges in
the manufacture, distribution, and administration of a vaccine. Hence,
although it is hoped that a vaccine will control the infection, it is
unlikely that it can eradicate it. It is important therefore not to
invest all hope for progress only in a vaccine; developing drug
treatments is also important. This underpins the need to develop
economic analysis to support policy that works over an extended period
of time. Moreover, since anxiety over COVID-19 adds to the impact of
lockdown on the economy, it is likely to take some time to dispel this
anxiety even if a vaccine or drugs are available, as evidenced by the
slow return to work in many places where the lockdown has been lifted.

Bespoke survey data will provide a useful way of learning about how
behaviour is responding to developments in the progression of the
disease, and there is also scope for designing field experiments that
give insights into economic behaviour. Given the high degree of
uncertainty and the psychological responses to the virus, there is value
in understanding how messaging matters alongside more conventional
incentives.

#### There is a pressing need for high-quality data to be made accessible for policy development and monitoring

Designing sound policy analysis requires good data. One of the novel
characteristics of the COVID-19 crisis is the swiftness of developments
occurring in the economy that require more than just the existing
conventional ways for measuring their impact. Financial transactions
data is one such option that provides a way of looking into individual
spending decisions on a day-to-day basis, but these data are typically
held by private financial institutions. This presents a challenge since
such data are often of commercial value. There has been some success in
making such data available, but there are a lot of data that are not
available to researchers and policy analysts. Below, we review what has
been learned by studying such data and we note that many other countries
have much better data accessibility than the UK. We would highlight data
availability as a significant challenge for the UK. We strongly
recommend for UK to strive to make more fine-grained datasets available
by mandating their release from the private firms and other parties
involved.

#### Responses implemented in the last five months will have a continuing legacy that will need to be managed

The scale and speed of measures taken to combat COVID-19 have had a
heavy toll on the economy–one that is likely to last for years. Of
particular concern is the impact of the economic shock on employment as
businesses shed workers, which may accelerate further as the furlough
program is wound down. Unemployment is a personal and familial challenge
for those who are directly affected, but it also creates challenges for
maintaining societal cohesiveness as inequality widens.

Although some important issues are covered, this report is not a
complete description of all dimensions of the economic impact of
COVID-19. For example, one feature of the crisis has been to support
businesses through emergency loan facilities. This will create a legacy
that weigh on the employment and investment decisions of firms, and also
potentially affect the behaviour of lenders going forward. The fact that
these loans are guaranteed by the UK government implies that dealing
with this legacy is a kind of industrial policy on how to manage
exposures in different firms and sectors of the economy. It is also
important to understand supply and demand constraints. Even if the
economy is opened, many activities may be curtailed by individuals who
still perceive significant risks associated with some economic
activities. Understanding these factors in a granular way is still a
work in progress.

A lot of useful economic analysis works by specifying targets and then
looking at the most economical and efficient ways of attaining these.
Thus, we have targets for reducing child poverty or limiting carbon
emissions that serve as a useful focal point for considering the value
of alternative policies.[^1] This approach is potentially powerful
in trying to limit the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the ability to
react to uncertainties is important, i.e. considering whether there
are some policies that are less contingent on specific knowledge that we
do not have; the case for wearing face masks/coverings is an example
here.

#### Continued support will be necessary, and could be aligned with longer-term strategic priorities

The UK government has been supporting the economy throughout the
crisis. It is important to continue this support in a strategically
informed way by focusing on policies that deliver economic benefits,
while minimising the risks of increasing transmission of COVID-19. There
is still an active learning process about the best way to do this. In a
period of crisis, there are opportunities to develop new policy
directions, and businesses can learn how to respond to these. The
government before the crisis had committed to net zero carbon emissions
by 2050 and to ‘level up’ the economy, in particular, addressing the
UK’s long-standing regional inequalities. There will be opportunities to
pursue these agendas as part of the recovery plan. For example,
promoting employment schemes supported by training programs in clean
energy sectors and home insulation can aid in reducing carbon
emissions.

Given the significant increase in unemployment, especially among the
young whose economic prospects are most severely hit by the crisis,
unemployment will need to be extensively studied, as has been done for
past recessions. Supportive policy requires a strategic approach
informed by data, and finding means to invest a significant share of GDP
in clean energy and new transportation networks is important.

# 1. An Integrated Evaluation of the Health and Economic Consequences of Lockdown Measures and Reopening Strategies

There are a number of possible conceptual frameworks for jointly
evaluating the economic and health consequences of lockdown measures.
These include in particular Green-Book-type cost-benefit analyses. Much
of recent economics research has, however, taken a different approach to
evaluating government measures in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, namely to quantify and visualise different policy alternatives
as tracing out a “policy frontier.”[^2] Figure 1 plots an illustrative
example of such a frontier (see left panel).

<img src="/diagrams/economics/image1.png" style="width:49%" />
<img src="/diagrams/economics/image2.png" style="width:49%" />

***Figure 1:*** Example policy frontier for integrated evaluation of
health and economic consequences of lockdown measures (Left). Targeted
measures such as TTI can *shift out* the policy frontier (Right).

Each policy alternative is evaluated in terms of two success metrics:
saving lives and preserving livelihoods or, more precisely, a measure of
constituents’ economic welfare. As an example, a tight and prolonged
lockdown may save many lives in the short term but comes with a large
welfare cost, whereas an extreme policy of no public health intervention
may cost many more lives in the short term but may result in a
relatively temporary recession and less severe economic costs. At the
same time, the example frontier is upward sloping in the vicinity of the
“do nothing” point, indicating that some form of intervention may both
save more lives and preserve more livelihoods.[^3] An important
advantage of the frontier approach vis-à-vis a traditional cost-benefit
analysis is that, while it quantifies the consequences of different
policy alternatives, it stops short of putting a particular *monetary*
value on life.[^4] It instead presents policymakers with a *menu* of
policy options that may all be acceptable depending on different
evaluations of such tradeoffs. It therefore explicitly recognises that
balancing tradeoffs between lives and livelihoods is ultimately a
political decision driven by many considerations including ethical ones.
At the same time, the frontier approach nevertheless identifies
suboptimal policy options that are dominated by others (those inside the
frontier and on the upward-sloping part).

The frontier approach also suggests that we should aim to find policy
interventions that *shift out* this frontier in the sense of both saving
more lives and preserving more livelihoods (see the right panel of
Figure 1). This is because such interventions are desirable
independently of subjective evaluations of the tradeoff between these.
As we discuss below, *targeted* lockdown measures and reopening
strategies can achieve precisely this goal. Finally, it is important
that the metric for economic success is a measure of people’s welfare
and not aggregate income (GDP). One important reason (though not the
only one) is that, as we also discuss in Section 6 below, the costs and
benefits of lockdown appear to be very unevenly distributed. Measures of
economic welfare take into account such distributional effects while GDP
does not.

An emerging field called epi-macro, which combines dynamic models from
epidemiology and macroeconomics to study the joint path of disease and
the economy, is being developed in response to the crisis for exploring
potential trade-offs between saving lives and preserving welfare in
quantitative models. A typical model marries a standard macroeconomic
model of household and firm behaviour with a simple epidemiological
model, typically a compartmental model such as an SIR or an SEIR
model.[^5] Both parts are then disciplined with data on the evolution of
the epidemic and the economy, e.g. of the type presented in Section 2.
Such an integrated approach is important to capture the two-way feedback
between infections and economic activity and the potentially complicated
non-linear dynamics of both the economy and the epidemic.

Some economists have considered the possibility of formally trying to
assess the trade-off between lives and livelihoods based on valuing
life.[^6] In effect, this is putting a value on human life to try to
achieve some kind of consistency in the decision-making process and to
assess the relative desirability of different points on the frontier in
Figure 1. It corresponds to a broadly utilitarian philosophy where costs
and benefits can be added. In principle, this approach provides a way of
trading off economic losses and lives saved, by putting them on a
comparable metric, i.e. money. Such methods were in part a reaction to
what were deemed arbitrary and inconsistent judgements being made over
treatments. And they are easier to apply to well-defined trade-offs and
to rationalise the allocation of resources *within* a spending envelope
rather than trying to decide how much to spend on health compared to
other forms of public spending or whether to raise taxation to spend
more on health care.

However, the trade-offs in the case of COVID-19 are not yet well
understood; we don’t really understand the impact on $R$, or the impact on
the economy in the short term, let alone the medium or long term impact
on economy and the secondary impact on health/welfare. There are good
reasons to think that there are vast inconsistencies in welfare
judgements across a wider range of policy decisions, particularly those
involving life and death. There is no effort to look at whether more
should be spent on road safety, airline safety, or saving malnourished
children in low income countries. A QALYs-based approach could be used
to inform this. But these decisions also depend on psychological
responses to different forms of death and even the way that these are
framed by the media. And arguably, one key role of the political process
is to make politicians accountable for making these judgements, instead
of believing that these things are amenable to scientific judgement.

Some recent analysis has tried to quantify the trade-off between loss
of income and lives lost. Such exercises have suggested that putting
large values on life in excess of those that are used in making
assessments between alternative treatments suggests that the costs of
the lockdown strategy are in excess of the benefits. Indeed, in their
central case, where GDP falls by 15%, 440,000 lives are saved and each
life is assumed to be worth five more QALYs valued at £30,000, and
people are expected to live on average for five more years, then the
loss in monetary terms is around £250 billion. However, as we have
stressed already, much of the economic cost may not be attributable to
the policy. There is also no attempt to look at the distributional
effects. How large are the long term impacts on physical and mental
health is also an issue, although they would tend to suggest, if
anything, that looking at short term QALYs is an underestimate of the
true societal cost.

Even if the idea of assessing trade-offs in this way is unattractive
in simple terms, many would find such exercises useful as one way of
informing economic policy. And it does open up the important question
that there is a trade-off that needs to be confronted and that lives
saved is not the only way of assessing success and failure as the
economic cost incurred in doing so also matters. But such methods have
their limitations. For example, nobody would seriously propose using
monetary valuation methods for the decision to go to war or whether to
use capital punishment, and it is not only because it is difficult to
give monetary values, but because important issues of principle are at
stake.

# 2. Tracking the Impact of Economic Shocks in Real-Time Transaction Data

The onset of the coronavirus pandemic has led to the rapid development
of an empirical literature in economics that uses individual financial
transactions made by households and firms to track the impact of spread
of virus, lockdown, and other government policies. The sources of such
data include financial applications on mobile phones, payments systems
operators, and traditional banks. Datasets vary in the exact information
they provide, but they generally provide a high-frequency measure of
household purchases, firm sales, and information on individual
characteristics. In this note, we describe some advantages of such data
and initial findings from a study of UK payments data, and we argue for
an expanded effort for data collection in the UK, which up to now lags
behind other major economies such as US in the availability of financial
transaction data for policy analysis.

A major advantage of payments data is its timeliness.[^7] Unlike
official national statistics, which often take months to compile,
financial transactions provide a near real-time account of economic
activity. This is a particularly important policy tool when the economy
is in crisis; it can support evidence-based timely policy responses to
major economic shocks. In Figure 2, we illustrate this by reporting the
year-on-year growth in weekly discretionary consumer spending across
different sectors in the U.K. from 1 January to 5 July 2020. This chart
comes from Hacioglu, Kaenzig, and Surico (2020b), which analyses
high-quality data on approximately 15,000 users of a financial app
(Money DashBoard). The vertical lines indicate the start (on 23 March)
and the relaxation (on 15 June) of the lockdown measures.

**Figure 2**: Average weekly spending in various sectors normalised to
100 in January (left); and year-on-year changes (right). Red line refers
to 2019 and blue line to 2020.

First, we can see that in line with the health system effects, the
largest decline in expenditure appears to have occurred during the
second week of March 2020 (when WHO announced the pandemic) and so
earlier than the introduction of either physical distancing policies (on
March 16) or lockdown measures (on March 23). Second, during May and
June–where the last two weeks have been characterised by some initial
and further easing of the lockdown measures respectively–consumer
spending has started to recover somewhat (especially retail, not
reported in this note), though the recovery in discretionary spending
until 5 July is still subdued.[^8] Third, the recovery has been quite
heterogeneous: durables goods and services sectors have recovered fully
or partially, but others such as restaurant and entertainment in
services have not. The results on both the introduction of the lockdown
and its partial easing suggest that fears and uncertainty may be also
holding back consumption, over and above any direct effect due to the
lockdown per se.

Also consistent with this, research has found that consumer expenditure
fell nearly as much in Sweden, where there has not been a complete
lockdown, as it did in Denmark, where there has been a complete lockdown
(see Figure 3, left panel, based on Andersen, Hansen, Johannesen, and
Sheridan (2020)). Analysis of Google Mobility data[^9] finds similar
patterns for workplace mobility (Resolution Foundation (2020)). Finally,
researchers have examined data from South Korea, which did not implement
a lockdown and has instead relied on testing and contact tracing; they
found that localised outbreaks led to large drops in local employment
(Aum, Lee, and Shin (2020)). To complete the international comparisons,
the right panel of Figure 3 plots expenditure growth across seven
countries based on Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) card data from
Carvalho et al. (2020). After a sudden, abrupt fall in spending
throughout the world in March, one observes a notable recovery in
consumer spending in most economies.

**Figure 3**. Consumer expenditure in the international economy.

An additional advantage of payments data is its granularity. This allows
one to measure which firms and households are most affected by economic
shocks, which is where many of the most relevant policy questions lie.
For example, one can determine which sectors and regions are hardest hit
by lockdown, and design fiscal stimulus accordingly. There is increasing
evidence from the transaction data that more affluent households have
cut spending by more than others. Figure 4 illustrates this point using
two separate data series. The left panel, from Hacioglu, Kaenzig, and
Surico (2020b), shows that UK households in the top quartile of the
labour income distribution have cut spending proportionally the most
during lockdown. The right panel, from Carvalho et al. (2020), shows
that households residing in the upper quintile of Madrid’s zip-codes by
income per capita have also adjusted most strongly. These observations
are also supported by research from the US (Chetty et al. (2020), Cox et
al. (2020)).

<img src="/diagrams/economics/image7.png" style="width:50%" />

**Figure 4**: Year-on-year growth in discretionary spending by income
levels (UK left, Spain right)

Moreover, as confirmed by Figure 5 below, the UK data reveal that more
affluent households have increased substantially their savings during
the lockdown by cutting non-essential spending on categories such as
restaurants, hospitality, recreation and culture, and travelling. On the
other hand, low-earning families (depicted as red line in Figure 4) have
increased their borrowing to fund spending on essential consumption such
as groceries, food, and utility bills.

<img src="/diagrams/economics/image10.png" style="width:60%" />

**Figure 5**: Decline in earnings, income and expenditure in June 2020
relative to June 2019 across different incomes groups.

Figure 5 shows that the decline in earnings exceeds the decline in
expenditure only for users at the very bottom of the income distribution
in UK. For all other groups, the pandemic shock is associated with a
significant positive gap between the decline in earnings and the decline
in spending, which is increasing in the level of income. On the other
hand, looking at the orange bars reveals that users with after-tax
income below £20,000 have faced a fall in income that is smaller than
the fall in their spending. It should be noted, however, that the change
in personal saving rates implied by the gap between the drop in income
and the drop in spending for this group is smaller than for users with
income in the range £20,000-30,000, and is only a fraction compared to
the groups above the median income.

## What have we learned from transaction data and what do they imply for the future?

The data shows important heterogeneity across income groups and also
points towards the key role that uncertainty plays in consumption
patterns. In particular, looking at granular financial transaction data
for a large number of users at weekly frequency suggests that the
decline in UK consumer spending is driven by high-powered/high-earning
affluent households. These families are cutting non-essential
consumption as a result of both the restrictive measures in place and
the health and economic crisis more generally. Furthermore, in the UK,
the largest drop in retail, restaurant, and transport spending started
well before the lockdown was introduced, suggesting that one should be
cautious in believing that reopening the economy can regain the level of
confidence and thus spending to the level seen before the crisis.

In terms of economic policies to support the economy, the joint analysis
of spending and income allowed by financial transaction data suggests
that measures to stimulate consumption have to channel the increased
savings by top earners back into spending. This is because many
low-earners are employed by those very sectors–such as restaurant,
recreation, hospitality, etc.–in which high-earning households have cut
most of their spending. Measures that are effective in doing this,
resulting in higher spending in retail, restaurant, hospitality,
recreation, etc. will also support salaries at the bottom of the income
distribution, thereby feeding back into aggregate demand through a
multiplier effect. However, what measures would be effective in doing
this is moot. There could be scope, for example, for targeted VAT cuts
towards these sectors but the modalities for this or other stimulus
measures require a more detailed analysis.

## What data and monitoring should be put in place for the future?

The financial transaction data used so far to analyse UK spending
patterns has provided valuable insights, and Hacioglu, Kaenzig, and
Surico (2020a) have shown that the time series of aggregate consumption
constructed with a bottom-up approach from this transaction data has a
correlation of 0.79 with the time series of household expenditure on
final consumption available from the national accounts. But several
other countries have transaction datasets whose sample sizes are far
greater than those provided by the financial apps, and which also
contain millions of users and billions of transactions (see additional
readings below). Such datasets come close to providing a real-time
snapshot of spending in the entire economy, and arguably contain a more
representative sample of consumers across age, occupation, and income
groups, thereby making them even more appropriate for macroeconomic
policy analysis. These datasets can also be used to understand very
detailed patterns, such as postcode-level spending dynamics and their
relation to disease incidence (Carvalho et al. (2020)).

Our recommendation is for the UK government and supporting bodies to
continue pursuing one of the most important and urgent goals of
obtaining more and more representative and fine-grained transactions
data from UK financial institutions for the purpose of monitoring the
impact of COVID-19 and associated policy interventions. Such data are
valuable assets in the current situation, and the UK should be the
vanguard in efforts to harness its power for effective and timely
policymaking.

# 3. Designing Targeted Interventions: Some Guiding Principles

As already mentioned in Section 1, targeted policies have the
potential to deliver superior outcomes in terms of both health and
economic outcomes. In terms of the policy frontier in Figure 1, such
“smart” policies may be able to alleviate the tradeoff between saving
lives and preserving livelihoods, thereby shifting out this frontier.
Smart policies can take multiple forms, including non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) or fiscal policies targeted at particular sectors,
firms, or individuals. Here we briefly discuss a few guiding principles
for designing such targeted interventions. Sections 4 and 8 make
particular suggestions for what such targeted interventions could look
like in practice.[^10]

The first guiding principle follows directly from the idea that
policies are “smart” if they do well in terms of both the metrics for
evaluating policies described in Figure 1, i.e. saving lives and
preserving constituents’ economic welfare. To deliver on these two
objectives, the two-by-two matrix in Figure 6 provides a guide for
policymakers aiming to identify desirable targeted policies. It
describes an adapted and simplified version of the “reopening index” of
Baqaee, Farhi, Mina, and Stock (2020). The basic idea is to categorise
each policy in terms of its *marginal* effect on (i) economic welfare
(the different rows) and on (ii) infection risk, as measured by the
effective reproduction number $R_t$ (the different
columns).[^11]

**Figure 6**: *Policies in the green top-right box are desirable whereas
those in the red bottom-left box are undesirable.*

In this idealised case in the figure above, only four different cases
are possible based on whether the policy under consideration has high or
low marginal effects on these two metrics. Smart targeted policies are
those in the green top right box: they yield a large marginal welfare
gain but with only a small marginal increase in $R_t$; or a
large marginal reduction in infection risk, i.e. a large negative
marginal $R_t$ but at only a small welfare cost. Conversely,
undesirable policies are those in the red bottom-left box: these yield
only a small marginal welfare gain but come with a high marginal
infection risk; or they yield only a small marginal reduction in
$R_t$ but at a high welfare cost. Finally, if a policy ends up
in one of the remaining two boxes (top left or bottom right), the case
for or against it is less clear cut. Acceptability to the population and
feasibility are, of course, also important: there is no point in
pursuing a policy that is too complex to be likely to succeed or is too
unpopular.

Some simple examples help illustrate the use of the matrix and how
some existing policies may be classified. These should be viewed as
illustrative; more empirical evidence and a more thorough evaluation of
the risks and benefits of these activities is needed. First, virtually
all countries hit by the COVID-19 pandemic have banned large indoor
events, e.g. large indoor sporting events or large nightclubs. In terms
of the matrix in Figure 6, this should most likely be viewed as a
desirable policy in the green top-right box. The risk of these events
serving as superspreading events means that banning them probably comes
with a large reduction in the effective reproduction number
$R_t$;[^12] at the same time the impact on constituents’
economic welfare is comparably modest. Two other examples falling into
the top-right box of desirable measures are likely: (i) the government’s
guidance during the lockdown exit advising people to “work from home if
you can” and (ii) mandatory face masks/coverings in shops–both bring
with them potentially sizable reductions in $R_t$ but
relatively low economic cost. In contrast, consider a policy of
subsidising eating out. Such a policy is more problematic because it
brings with it an increased infection risk, i.e. a potentially high
marginal $R_t$. It would therefore likely fall into either
the top left or bottom left box.[^13]

A second guiding principle, one that applies to all economic
policymaking, is the so-called *targeting principle*: policies should
aim to target specific externalities or frictions. In the absence of a
clear rationale for a policy in the form of such “market imperfections”,
it may be better to not pursue this policy. In the case of the COVID-19
pandemic, one potentially important externality is an “infection
externality” by which individuals probably underweigh the risk of
infecting others and therefore engage in less voluntary physical
distancing than would be epidemiologically optimal (see e.g. Farboodi,
Jarosch, and Shimer (2020)). There are many other potential frictions
and valid rationales for policy intervention, but for each policy, it is
important to be clear about which ones a policy aims to target and also
how it plans to achieve those ends.

A third guiding principle is that policy needs to be flexible enough to
adjust to uncertainties, in particular, about the future evolution of
the epidemic. In this regard, an important lesson from economic theory
is that a policy that does well in environments with lots of uncertainty
often features *state dependence*, meaning that policy is contingent on
and changes with the realisations of uncertainty. In the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic, smart policy in many cases should be dependent on the
state of the epidemic and the economy and, in particular, change if
epidemic and economic markers cross certain thresholds.

# 4. Supply-Chains Under Lockdown: Assessing Costs and Designing Targeted Interventions

Locking down a community and closing down economic activity in certain
sectors is costly economically and those costs are not equally spread
throughout the economy. For example, key production activities, such as
textiles, chemicals, iron and steel, etc., that are more central in
economy-wide supply chains have a much wider impact on the economy when
idled. Further, even if these central production nodes are kept open
during a lockdown, their scale of operations is likely to decrease as
downstream activities like retail, which serve UK households directly,
are kept shut, thereby limiting their demand for intermediate goods and
services. Finally, employment declines in sectors under lockdown spill
over to the rest of the economy via final demand, as households scale
back consumption in face of job loss and income uncertainty.

The research on production networks provides a framework to organise
these complex patterns of propagation of economic disruption under
lockdown. It allows one to estimate and quantify the economic costs of a
particular lockdown strategy, either already implemented or proposed.
Further, it allows policymakers to discover optimal targeted lockdown
strategies. Hence, it is an important input to policy now as we
partially re-open the economy, and in the future, if further limited
lockdowns are required.

A policymaker defining a lockdown strategy is solving a coupled
contagion and production problem: finding which economic sectors to
close to minimise damages to the economy while keeping down COVID-19
transmission. In particular, the partial reopening of some economic
sectors increases labour mobility, thereby increasing contact rates–both
while commuting to and in the workplace–and the likelihood of new local
COVID-19 outbreaks. These effects would be dictated by the
geographical distribution of employment in these sectors, commuting
patterns, and the epidemiology of COVID-19 diffusion. The network
perspective on production that we introduce here is a first step towards
an integrated epi-production network framework, which could allow
policymakers to achieve superior outcomes by pushing the possibility
frontier outwards via targeting, as illustrated in Figure 1.

## The framework in practice: lockdown costs and optimal interventions

In what follows we provide an example of how to apply this
methodology.[^14] For a given policy experiment, we consider aggregate
GDP as the economic outcome of interest, and we consider the total
number of people commuting to work as a proxy for meeting rates.
Implicitly, this assumes pure homogenous mixing in the diffusion process
both across sectors and across space. This serves purely as an
illustration. The ingestion of further data sources (e.g. spatial
patterns of activity and commuting flows) and collaboration with
epidemiologists will allow us to incorporate a more realistic diffusion
process. We return to these considerations towards the end of this
document.

In our representation of the UK economy, there are 54 sectors, all of
which may trade with each other, hire workers, and produce outputs. Some
sectors’ outputs are intermediate and other sectors produce final
consumption goods that households can purchase. Households earn wages by
supplying labour to different sectors in the economy. In the model’s
equilibrium, the prices of all goods and the wages paid by each sector
are such that supply and demand equate across the economy. Further, we
input into the model sector-specific measures of both the amount of
working from home possible and the proportion of parents with school age
children, whose labour supply is affected by school closures.

As an illustration, we evaluate here the May 10<sup>th</sup> UK
government policy announcement regarding lockdown easing.[^15] The main
change of this announcement relative to the lockdown in place since the
middle of March is that workers without school-age children, who worked
in sectors not directly shut down by government policy, were actively
encouraged to enter the labour force by travelling to work. Under this
new policy scenario, we estimate that total output in the economy falls
by nearly 24% relative to the pre-COVID situation. The number of
people working will be 22 million, with roughly 8 million people out of
work or furloughed, about 15 million workers being able to work from
home and the remaining 7 million commuting to their workplace.[^16]

We then explore alternative lockdown strategies that can help
policymakers in designing more effective reopening strategies. Namely,
we ask whether there is an alternative to the current policy scenarios
that is superior in its GDP impact, while requiring a smaller amount of
physical commuter flows and therefore lower contact rates. To do this,
we search for the targeted network reopening that minimises GDP falls
under the constraint that only 5 million people commute to work and a
total of 15 million people working remotely from home. Compared to the
May 10<sup>th</sup> scenario above, this scenario keeps the same number
of workers working from home–but not necessarily distributed across the
same sectors, while allowing for a slightly smaller number of people
physically commuting to their workplace. We estimate that the optimal
strategy leads to a fall in economic output by 18%. As such, the optimal
targeted strategy pushes the policy frontier outwards by achieving both
better GDP performance and smaller contact rate.

To understand why the network-targeted policy may offer a superior
performance in resolving the coupled contagion and production problem,
it is useful to compare it to the current, post-May 10<sup>th</sup>
policy. The government policy is stark in its employment allocation:
many sectors will be fully back to productive capacity, while some
sectors are mandated to be closed. The first aspect of this policy
generates substantial commuting flows, whereas full business closures
continue to impose large economic costs, including constraining the
demand for the outputs of sectors that are fully open.

An optimal targeting policy, instead, reduces the number of sectors that
are fully open, targeting only those with greater direct and
supply-chain impact on the economy. It also reduces the economic
distortions associated with having some full-sector lockdowns, by
prescribing partial lockdowns through part-time on-site working
(supplemented by the maximum possible level of work from home). By doing
so, the optimal targeting policy can deliver GDP outcomes improve on the
implemented policy while requiring smaller commuting flows and lower
contact rates.

## Ongoing work and further considerations.

The framework described above relies on accurate measurements of the UK
economy, combining information on sector-to-sector linkages and
lockdown-specific data. Over the past two months, we have worked closely
with the ONS to improve the data inputs into our model and are now in a
position to refine our estimates further. One missing ingredient so far
is information on the size of the furloughed workforce by sector that
would allow us to better proxy for final demand forces.

We have also been able to source data on the geography of sectoral
employment across the UK, together with the associated commuting and
return to work patterns. This opens up the possibility of coupling our
production network framework with an epidemiological model, thereby
delivering an integrated policy tool that takes sectoral and spatial
heterogeneity into account when computing both economic costs *and*
localised disease dynamics, given commuting and workplace contact rates
under particular lockdown scenarios. This tool would allow a refinement
of optimal policy solutions: given an *$R_t$* target in any
given region, what is the optimal lockdown strategy ensuring that such
targets are met at a minimum economic cost?

We conclude by discussing three policy questions that can additionally
be addressed through this network methodology. First, given the nature
of supply chains spanning the entire world, the effectiveness of the
existing UK strategy will depend on the policies that other countries
implement, in particular, those that are tightly connected to UK in the
production process and consumption. Extending the production network
analysis to global supply chains allows the government to identify how
different phases in the contagion process that countries may experience
have an impact on UK production. The analysis in Bonadio, Huo,
Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020) presents a first step in this
direction and concludes that, across countries, about one third of GDP
contraction during the pandemic derives from the global supply chain
disruptions generated by lockdowns occurring abroad.

Second, the UK government is already injecting an unprecedented amount
of money into the economy. Injections are needed to support households,
cushion unemployment, avoid a prolonged loss of revenue leading to
cascading failures or seizures in production, and support health of the
financial network. However, it is only by targeting these injections
that economic feedbacks are generated. Further, the limited fiscal
government capacity implies that subsidisation of certain economic
sectors should be financed by taxing other sectors. The network approach
allows us to tackle this question and highlight the sectors that should
be subsidised and the sectors that should finance such subsidies.[^17]

Third, the current crisis has brought to the forefront the need to
monitor and design supply chains that are responsive to shocks. Indeed,
shortages of specific goods and supply chain disruptions (from
ventilators to flour) are a standout feature of the past few months. How
can policymakers keep key supply chains functioning? Which firms are
essential for meeting demand of key goods and services in a crisis?
Answers to these questions require substantially more granular datasets
involving firm-to-firm transactions. This would enable researchers and
policymakers to map out firm-level supply chains and apply emerging
network-based insights on how to locate and safeguard key supply chains.
Relative to other countries, the UK is currently lagging in this area,
chiefly because of the lack of such granular data. Nevertheless, by
working with payment systems operators (and the ONS), it would be
possible to put together this data infrastructure, and therefore enable
real-time measurement and policy interventions that could avoid key
supply chain disruptions.[^18]

# 5. Trade-offs Between Economic and Health Risks When Considering the Lockdown Release Date

Some of the most important decisions regarding lockdowns have to do with
timing. When should the lockdown be eased? At what speed and to what
extent should the lockdown be eased? How should these decisions depend
on the state of the epidemic? At the time of writing, the UK has been
removing lockdown restrictions for some time and is considering whether
to take additional steps or to reverse previous ones. To try to answer
such questions, economists have considered various reopening scenarios
through the lens of integrated macroeconomic and epidemiological models
that we have already discussed in Section 1. Such an integrated
perspective is important when considering these questions because the
interaction of epidemiological and macroeconomic dynamics means that
such timing choices can have subtle and non-linear, or even non-monotone
effects.

A key cautionary lesson is that a tight lockdown that is released too
quickly or too fully would probably lead to adverse outcomes in terms of
*both* lives and livelihoods. To be precise, too quickly or too fully
here means relaxing the lockdown without sufficient regard for the state
of the pandemic, the capacity of the health care system, and
epidemiological markers such as the effective reproduction number. In
terms of the policy frontier introduced in Figure 1, an abrupt reopening
strategy risks yielding a point *inside* this frontier, meaning that it
is dominated by other policy options.

The rationale is simple: an abrupt and premature lockdown exit would
lead to a second wave of infections that would bring with it both a
higher death toll and additional costs for the economy.[^19] One reason
to believe that the economic consequences of such a strategy would
probably be dire is the evidence that perceptions about risk of
infection lead to voluntary physical distancing, so that a second wave
would lead to falling economic activity even in the absence of a renewed
lockdown. We have presented such evidence in Section 2 where we showed
that UK, Denmark, and Sweden consumer spending declined already before
the introduction of either physical distancing policies or lockdown
measures (see Figures 2 and 3), consistent with the idea that fear of
infections and uncertainty may be holding back consumption over and
above any direct effect due to the lockdown per se.

Given this evidence, a possible consequence of a prematurely-relaxed
lockdown would not only be an elevated death toll but also a *double-dip
recession*: the first dip, which the UK has already experienced, was due
to the initial lockdown; the second dip would be due to a second wave of
infections and the resulting effect on economic activity. As already
mentioned, the overall result would be adverse outcomes in terms of
*both* lives and livelihoods (“a point inside the frontier”).

Through the lens of integrated macroeconomic and epidemiological models,
there are other policy options that are probably preferable to an abrupt
lockdown exit.[^20] One such option is a cautious reopening strategy
that aims to keep the effective reproduction number below one (or at
least in the vicinity of one) and the health care system below capacity
while methods for managing the epidemic improve, e.g. by means of a
potential vaccine or better disease treatment methods. Depending on
assumptions about the effectiveness of relatively cheap individual-level
prevention measures (such as improved personal hygiene and the wearing
of face masks/coverings), these models predict that it may be possible
to achieve this aim with targeted lockdown measures in place like those
discussed in Sections 3 and 4. This strategy then dominates a fast and
complete lockdown exit in the sense that it results in an overall
welfare cost that is roughly similar but saves a larger number of
lives.[^21] The situation can be improved further by coupling such a
cautious lockdown exit strategy with other targeted approaches that we
discuss elsewhere in this report, such as work rotation, and TTI
schemes; in short, other schemes that expand the policy frontier and are
thus more effective than indiscriminate lockdowns.

# 6. The Pandemic and the Labour Market

The pandemic has brought about an unprecedented labour market shock. The
objective of many emergency policies has been to enable otherwise viable
businesses to survive and to prevent inefficient layoffs by easing
liquidity constraints and subsidising wages.[^22] In principle, this
should enable a faster return to “normal” as restrictions are lifted.
However, labour market strategy should be sensitive to the persistence
of the crisis and the likelihood of further waves of infection; much of
the current approach is premised on the assumption that this shock is
temporary.

Workplace testing and preventing infections at work are key elements of
any strategy to open up the economy. Many workers are continuing to work
while sick with (mild) coronavirus symptoms (Adams-Prassl, Boneva,
Golin, and Rauh (2020c)). Workers without sick pay beyond the statutory
minimum are especially reluctant to return to work from furlough
(Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh (2020c)). There is some
adaptation to work from home, but this is occurring slowly and unequally
across different occupations and industries (Adams-Prassl, Boneva,
Golin, and Rauh (2020b)).

Coordination between the end/reform of the *Coronavirus Job Retention
Scheme* (CJRS) and changed school schedules requires careful
consideration. Mothers have been 10 percentage points more likely than
fathers to have initiated the decision to be furloughed (as opposed to
it being fully or mostly the employers’ decision) but there is no such
gender gap amongst childless workers (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and
Rauh (2020c)). Women with children find it more difficult to be
productive at home (Adams-Prassl (2020)). The crisis has exacerbated
gender inequality in the labour market and mothers have taken on more of
the extra childcare duties (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh
(2020a); Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh (2020b); Andrew et al.
(2020)). Innovative strategies to enable worker-led flexibility, such as
the right to work from home and to request flexible scheduling, for
facilitating parents to work in the face of disrupted childcare
schedules are crucial.

## What do we know?

COVID-19 is exacerbating existing labour market inequalities. Women,
ethnic minorities, those with less education, workers on low incomes,
and those in insecure work arrangements have been more likely to lose
their job or suffer falls in earnings even if they have remained
employed (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh (2020a); Blundell, Costa
Dias, Joyce, and Xi (2020); Benzeval et al. (2020); Joyce and Xu
(2020)).

The government support package has so far provided an effective safety
net for eligible workers and prevented even higher job losses. However,
there is evidence of considerable moral hazard within the system. The
majority of furloughed workers reported positive work hours when this
was not permitted by the policy. In particular, furloughed workers who
had their salary topped up by their employer reported working more
hours. A fifth of furloughed employees surveyed by the *COVID Inequality
Project* report being asked to work by their employer in violation of
the terms of the scheme.[^23] This is particularly prevalent in
occupations where it is easier to work from home. For example, 45% of
furloughed employees working in ‘Computer and mathematical’ occupations
have been asked to work while on furlough, while the corresponding share
for ‘Transportation and material moving’ is 2%. Further, workers on
insecure contracts[^24] have been more likely to be furloughed. These
workers also anticipate a much higher likelihood of eventually losing
their jobs. Therefore, the design of the furlough scheme needs further
thinking to make it more supportive for the workers and efficient for
the UK government.

There is some adaptation to work from home, but this is occurring slowly
and unequally across different occupations and industries. The share of
tasks that workers reported as being feasible to do from home increased
between March and May (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh (2020b)).
This increase was mainly driven by an increase within occupations in
which many workers were already capable of doing all tasks from home.
However, within almost all occupations there is some portion of jobs
that can be done from home. Understanding what drives differences in the
ability to work from home across workers and firms is important for
understanding what policies could be used to encourage working from home
for a wider set of jobs.

Returning to work outside the home brings more opportunities for
exposure to and transmission of the virus. 50% of workers continue to
report positive work hours outside the home while experiencing mild
coronavirus symptoms (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh (2020c)).
While the majority of furloughed workers would prefer to return to work
even at 80% of their usual pay, workers without sick pay are less likely
to support a return to work even when controlling for detailed job
characteristics (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh (2020b)).

Women have been hit harder economically. This is not only because men
and women tend to work in different occupations and industries. Even
after controlling for occupation and industry, women are significantly
more likely to have lost their job or be furloughed (Adams-Prassl,
Boneva, Golin, and Rauh (2020a); Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh
(2020b); Andrew et al. (2020)). Amongst those furloughed, women are less
likely to have had their wage topped up after controlling for occupation
and industry (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, and Rauh (2020c)). While men
with children have increased the amount of childcare they do on a
typical working day, the increase for women has been even larger. There
must be a risk that this inhibits work and career progression for
mothers. While part of the impact has already materialised in the short
run, the potential for long-run scars in careers is large.

## What does this suggest about strategies for opening-up the economy?

That a significant proportion of individuals have continued to work
outside the home while experiencing cold-like symptoms is a public
health hazard. Workplace testing should be incentivised to catch
outbreaks quickly. Occupations where workers frequently come into
physical contact with others should be prioritised; workers in these
high-contact occupations are also less likely to have access to
additional sick pay beyond the statutory minimum (Adams-Prassl, Boneva,
Golin, and Rauh (2020c)). An effective public health strategy and
economic recovery are complements, and not in conflict with one another.

More research is needed into the strategies that firms and workers are
employing to facilitate working from home. There is wide dispersion in
the amount of work that people report being able to do from home, even
within the same occupation and industries. The previous all-or-nothing
nature of the CJRS scheme could have contributed to the relatively small
changes in the ability to work from home in many occupations; why invest
in new technologies or ways of working if none of your workers are
allowed to work? For this reason (and others), the shift to “flexible
furloughing”, where part-time work is permitted, is a positive policy
shift. Moral hazard in the current system also suggests that revenue or
production audits could speed up the return to work for those who can do
so from home.

The prospect of further waves of infection and continued physical
distancing measures in some form suggest that the impact of the pandemic
will persist. This is important because arguments in favour of
subsidising short-time work assume that the economic shock in question
is temporary. Supporting firms that are not able to adapt to physical
distancing measures in the medium term prevents the reallocation of
workers and resources to activities that can continue in the “new
normal” (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (2020)). That workers on insecure
contracts are more likely to be furloughed is suggestive that the
furloughing scheme may simply be delaying unemployment. Indeed,
furloughed workers are much more likely to fear losing their jobs; they
report a 15% higher likelihood of losing their job before August than
non-furloughed employees.

While the persistence of the shock limits the desirability of further
extensions to the CJRS, the timing of the removal of CJRS and schools
being reopened must be carefully considered to prevent a further
deterioration in parents’, and in particular, women’s career prospects.
Women have been hit harder economically and have picked up a higher
proportion of extra childcare duties. Initiatives to support worker-led
flexible schedules and working from home to provide more opportunities
for women to remain in the labour force while childcare and school times
are disrupted, are crucial.

# 7. Economic Issues in Physical Distancing

## Estimating the impact of physical distancing policies on firm-level productivity

Physical distancing and the augmented health and safety
measures–including minimum distance requirements such as the 2 meters
rule–have been lauded as important drivers of the recent reduction in
COVID-19 cases in many countries that adopted stringent measures. And
there appear to have been falls in infection rates following such
measures being put in place. The economic impact that physical
distancing may have will probably vary considerably across firms and
even across establishments within the same firm. There are multiple
factors, including sectoral heterogeneous ability of firms to encourage
work from home, that generate this kind of variation along with the
physical layout of the space, e.g. the extent to which enclosed spaces
can be ventilated.

There is little prior literature that has studied the interplay between
physical space as a factor of production and productivity. And, there
seems to be huge dispersion in the extent to which space may be a
constraining factor in production. Figure 7 below presents an estimate
of the average space per member of kitchen staff across 46,912 kitchens
located in physical premises in English and Welsh hospitality businesses
(restaurants and hotels). Across such businesses, the average physical
space available in rooms designated as “kitchens” for kitchen staff
members or cooks ranges from less than 1.8 square meters in the lower
quintile to more than 3.9 square meters in the upper quintile in the
distribution across districts. Naturally, we would expect this variation
to be even more significant across establishments within districts.

<img src="/diagrams/economics/image12.png" style="width:70%" />

**Figure 7:** Estimate of average space per kitchen staff member across
English and Welsh Local Authority Districts.

Physical distancing requirements, such as 2 meters rule, make it
virtually impossible for some establishments to operate. Others might
have to significantly downsize their operations in order to be able to
maintain physical distancing in the workplace.

Understanding the economic impact that physical distancing can have is
imperative to help shape our understanding of the underlying policy
trade-offs. The importance that physical distancing in the workplace has
in COVID-19 transmission may be quite large. To illustrate, Table 1
examines the statistical relationship between the COVID-19 death rate
(DV) and a measure of density in the workplace using variation across
local authorities. It suggests that in the months of March and April,
COVID-19 mortality rates across English and Welsh districts were notably
higher in districts that have noticeably less average space per kitchen
worker–a proxy for space use in production as a whole. However, there is
no statistically significant correlation in May which may be due to the
lockdown and physical distancing measures having become more effective.

**Table 1:** The statistical relationship between district-specific
monthly COVID-19 mortality rate estimates and a measure of density in
the workplace. Table presents the conditional and unconditional correlation between a measure of density in the workplace. This is studied for cooks and kitchen helpers. The amount of space available in a district is the total floor space in M2 available in rooms labeled as "kitchens" in physical premises classified as providing Hospitality services in the VOA lists. The number of kitchen staff is imputed from BRES employment data in Hospitality and Accommodation services along with a detailed occupation to industry mapping. The relationship with the ONS estimate of the age-standardized COVID-19 death rate disappears once the lockdown became effective.

It is important to leverage data on the physical make-up of economic
establishments from the UK’s Valuation Office Agency along with granular
data on employment and turnover at the establishment to calibrate an
economic model that can help us to quantify the productivity losses
under different forms of physical distancing. Further, the work will
elaborate on estimating what the sector- and region-specific costs of
physical distancing may look like, thereby allowing policymakers to
adopt more targeted support measures using well-known data and
mechanisms to target any eventual support. However, it is clear that
future research will have to go more deeply into isolating channels
since this is important from a policy perspective.

## Behaviour and spontaneous physical distancing: lessons for policy

### What are the economic issues?

Recent government policy has been formulated on the basis of predictions
and scenarios using standard epidemiological models like those employed
by the Imperial College London group (Ferguson et al. (2020)). The
models used for predicting the course of the epidemic are explicitly
non-behavioural, i.e. no attempt has been made to directly model
*spontaneous behaviour* by individuals in the population.[^25] Instead,
the analysis of different policy options has been carried out by making
assumptions about compliance rates, and then using standard epidemiology
techniques, such as contact matrices, forecast possible future
trajectories of the infection. The epidemiologists working on these
models were very upfront about these methodological choices.[^26]

As shown in Sections 2 and 5, we know that changes in infection risks
cause significant changes in spontaneous behaviour and that such changes
preceded restrictions imposed by health authorities and the government.
In addition, a significant proportion of overall decreases in social and
economic activity can be ascribed to changes in behaviour rather than to
lockdown policies.[^27] Thus, to better understand the effects of
and need for policy, we need more insights into behaviour in the face
of epidemics. Until recently, most research has centered on theoretical
analyses of individual behaviour (see Toxvaerd (2020a) and references
therein for a survey of the early literature). These theoretical studies
need to be supplemented with detailed empirical studies of actual
behaviour. Recently, new data have allowed for a richer analysis of
actual physical distancing, using a number of data sources such as
mobile phone data (Ajzenman, Cavalcanti, and Da Mata (2020)), credit
card transactions data (Carvalho et al. (2020)), restaurant booking
data, Google’s Community Mobility Reports, Apple’s Social Distancing
Maps, etc. In addition, other data that can be used for this type of
analysis include numbers of commuters on public transport and road
usage, people using the furlough scheme, fines for breaking physical
distancing orders (collected by the National Police Chief’s Council),
etc. Data collected via new COVID-19 tracing apps will also be very
valuable. Bringing more of this data into the investigation of
behavioural impacts of COVID-19 is an important task for future
research. Moreover, there is an urgent need to make such data available
for research purposes.

To better understand individual behaviour, we also need to analyse
private incentives and tradeoffs along different dimensions. Most
existing research on economic epidemiology has focused on pure infection
externalities i.e. the effects that different levels of infection risks
would have on individuals’ behaviour and how such individuals’ decisions
would influence infection dynamics and the wellbeing of others. In very
recent research, an additional focus has been on so-called economic
externalities e.g. though the labour market. Policy instruments such as
the furlough scheme and statutory sick-pay alter the tradeoffs faced by
individuals and therefore have implications for what decisions
individuals take. A fuller understanding of individual behaviour will
need to consider the competing externalities that work through exposure
decisions and economic interactions.

With the urgent need to understand the effects of easing the lockdown
in different ways in real-time, it is important for policymakers to
conduct or commission research into behavioural responses towards eased
restrictions. Going forward, it would be prudent to secure access to
datasets in convenient formats that can make such research feasible, so
as to make maximal use of data in formulating policy.

As an example of the need for such new research on behaviour, consider
the policies and targeted interventions outlined in Sections 1 and 4.
While the analysis of optimal policy is desirable because it shows what
the best of all possible outcomes may be, however in practice, such
policies are implemented partly through voluntary acts by individuals.
Thus, the extent to which policies can be implemented depends on
individual incentives to comply with rules and recommendations. A full
analysis of policy needs to consider both what is desirable in terms of
positive economic impact and negative or null economic impact on
$R_t$ and what is achievable in terms of acceptability and
feasibility, and in determining the latter an understanding of behaviour
plays a central role. Well-meaning policies to control infectious
diseases that ignore the effects of spontaneous behaviour may backfire
and lead to unintended and undesirable outcomes (for an example, see
Toxvaerd (2019)).

# 8. Workforce Rotation Within an Organisation: A Micro-Strategy to Shift the Policy Frontier Upwards

We now discuss a simple scheme of rotation of the workforce or student
population that can be adopted to allow for permanent activity and, at
the same time, avoid possible COVID-19 outbreaks. We illustrate this
with a concrete example, but the idea is considerably more general as we
discuss in detail below.[^28]

*Example.* A single member of a large organisation has been infected
with a contagious disease at a random point of time.[^29] Initially, the
disease spreads exponentially in the predominantly healthy population of
the organisation: the number of the infected individuals doubles every 5
days.[^30] The example ignores spread to household and other contacts
outside of the organisation.

The organisation reacts to the infection with a delay of 30 days after
which all its members are tested, and all infected individuals are
counted and isolated. The delay in the organisational reaction may occur
because many infections may be asymptomatic, symptoms are not reported,
individual-level testing is delayed, or organisational decision-making
takes time. Without further interventions, the moment at which the
organisation reacts, there would be $2^6=64$ infections.[^31]

Now, consider introducing a rotation scheme: the organisation is divided
into two equally sized groups and, at each instance, one group actively
attends the organisation, whereas the other group stays isolated. Let us
optimise frequency of the rotations with the objective to minimise the
size of the final outbreak.

Option 1. One group is always active, and the other group is always
inactive. An example is the UK school policy that has reopened only
certain school grades, whereas other grades remained home-schooled. This
scheme leads to 32 infections. This is half of the infections obtained
without intervention as, under option 1, the disease spreads only if the
exogenously infected individual happens to be in the active group.

Option 2. Daily rotation. A scheme that rotates the two groups daily
exposes the infected group to 15 active days before the organisation
reacts. Thus, the infection doubles 3 times leading to 2^3=8 infections
only. This is a quarter of the outbreak size obtained with option 1 and
one eighth of the infections obtained with no intervention.

*General principle*. Since it is initially unknown which group is
infected, every rotation scheme induces an average number of 15 active
days for the infected group. Rotation schemes, however, differ in the
induced distribution of the numbers of the active days for which the
disease spreads in the infected group. In option 1, the infected group
is active for 30 days with probability 0.5 and, otherwise, never active.
In option 2, the infected group is active 15 days for sure. Since
infection spreads exponentially, a policymaker who wishes to minimise
infections dislikes dispersion in the distribution of active days of the
infected group. Hence, the frequent rotation is optimal across all
rotation schemes. The effectiveness of these rotation strategies is
immune to small implementation mistakes, for example, some mixing across
groups during the rotation phase (Ely, Galeotti, and Steiner (2020)).

#### Rotation schemes and wage subsidies

The production network approach discussed in Section 3 predicts that
optimal targeted lockdown strategies involve the partial reopening of
certain sectors. For industries operating in these sectors, policymakers
should implement such rotation schemes as these will facilitate
containment of the virus. Policymakers may incentivise rotation schemes
with *short time work policies* that could provide subsidies for hour
reductions to workers and employers of firms joining those schemes, see
Giupponi and Landais (2020) for a discussion of the effects of short
time work programs.

#### Rotation schemes and test, track, and isolate (TTI)

Rotation schemes should be complemented, whenever possible, with TTI
schemes within the organisation. TTI can be used to detect infections in
the first place, so that the reaction time of the organisation to a
possible outbreak is reduced. The policymaker may choose to subsidise
the adoption of TTI for firms in key economic sectors or sectors for
which the nature of production limits the implementation of physical
distancing. For other sectors, the policymakers may incentivise the
adoption of TTI by conditioning wage subsidies programs on good
organisational practices.

#### Rotation schemes and schools

The average school class size in UK is around 27 for primary school and
22 for secondary school. The restriction to class size of 15 pupils
means that those classes needs to be cut roughly in half, thereby
requiring a substantial increase in classroom capacity. An option for
the September reopening of schools, in which this is not feasible, is to
adopt such rotation schemes.

#### Rotation at society level

The idea of rotation can also be applied to the society as a whole, as
in Karin et al. (2020) and Alon et al. (2020), which calibrate the
effect of such strategies for GDP and contagion. They consider
strategies where the economy is opened for two weeks and then lockdown
is introduced for a certain number of days. The rationale behind this is
to exploit biological facts about the timing of symptoms and of
infectiousness. For these strategies to be effective, it is important
that the biological facts of the virus are understood well and that the
policymaker is able to synchronise the interventions to the infection
cycle; this could require a substantial implementation effort.

# 9. Planning for the Possibility of Waning Immunity

## What have we learned during the crisis?

Given the severity of the current epidemic, most recent efforts and
policy thinking has been devoted to the most urgent issues. Little
attention has been given to planning ahead: the situation beyond the
first great wave of the pandemic.

A major lesson learned since the outbreak of the pandemic is that
preparedness, a well-functioning infrastructure, and the ability to
swiftly and decisively introduce policies are key to managing the
economic and health-related fallout from COVID-19 pandemic shock.
International comparisons point to the fact that countries with previous
experience of similar diseases, such as SARS, were rapid in introducing
policies like test and trace, widespread wearing of face
masks/coverings, and travel restrictions. For these reasons, it is
important that the early failures in dealing with the UK epidemic prompt
us to carefully think about how we can best prepare for the years
ahead.

## What do we not know?

One great unknown about COVID-19 is whether individuals who recover can
be reinfected. While it is not yet known for sure, the scientific
consensus at the moment is that recovery probably confers some temporary
immunity to reinfection. But few experts are willing to make predictions
about immunity in the medium and long run. The only way to know for sure
that immunity is not waning is to wait and see. In other words, to
conduct longitudinal studies that are impossible in the short run.

Experts on related coronaviruses suggest that in the absence of any firm
evidence, experience from other coronaviruses should be the placeholder
or default assessment.[^32] What this means is that all those people
that have recovered from infection during the first wave of the epidemic
may become susceptible to reinfection in the medium run. In addition, it
means that the infection may become endemic and never get fully
eradicated. While the arrival of effective vaccines and antivirals would
certainly make the control of the epidemic easier, there is no guarantee
that such pharmaceutical innovations would enable a full eradication of
the disease. Past experience has shown that eradication of even vaccine
preventable diseases may be beyond reach and many epidemiologists and
virologists remain skeptical that an effective vaccine is within
immediate reach. Even so, the protective effects of vaccines may be
temporary and so population immunity must be sustained through time via
a continued vaccine program, which poses considerable practical
challenges.

The prospect of waning immunity is considered a realistic default
scenario by infectious disease epidemiologists (see statements in
Regalado (2020) and Resnick (2020)), so policymakers need to actively
plan for this possibility.

As outlined above, we need the results of longitudinal studies to
fully understand how the disease will evolve. A recent but preliminary
study suggests that antibodies may wane in as little as three months
after the initial exposure, but the interpretation of this study is
still not clear (see Long et al. (2020)).

## How do we formulate policies in this type of uncertainty?

Any economic analysis rests on the assumptions that we make about the
properties of the disease. Thus, any policy prescriptions must also be
understood in the context of what we currently know about the basic
epidemiological facts of COVID-19. To fully understand the shape of the
frontier in Figure 1, we need to know what kind of disease we are
facing. In Section 5, we also emphasised the need to consider a wide
range of interventions and the importance of having policies that can be
sensitive to the duration of the shock and to the evolving understanding
of the nature of acquired immunity. Policies should ideally be able to
adjust to uncertainties and work whether immunity is acquired
indefinitely or is temporary.

As of now, we do not know some of the basic immunological properties
of COVID-19, so it is prudent to think about alternatives other than the
best-case scenario in which immunity is permanent. Just as dykes and
fire breaks are put in place to counter floods and wildfires, so
appropriate infrastructure and processes must be put in place to better
manage the economic consequences of any recurrence of the disease. Even
if it turns out that the recovery from COVID-19 does confer permanent
immunity, a mutated version or an altogether different disease may come
next. Such preparations will also be useful then.

In Giannitsarou, Kissler, and Toxvaerd (2020), the consequences for
optimal lockdown policies are analysed from a calibrated
economic-epidemiological model with births, deaths, disease-induced
mortality, pre-symptomatic infection, and waning immunity. It is shown
that the qualitative properties of optimal lockdown depend on how fast
immunity wanes and so one cannot take a wait-and-see approach here (for
a non-technical description of this work, see Toxvaerd (2020b)). It is
important to learn from the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we
cannot afford to be complacent. Governments at the national and local
level must ensure that experience and best practices are widely
disseminated, and policies are put in place to deal with similar
situations in future.

The following four key aspects, some of which are considered in other
DELVE reports, deserve great priority:

First, schools must ensure that any future recurrence of the epidemic
cause minimal disruption to children’s education by preparing better
online provision for teaching and examinations, rotation schemes that
minimise the potential for disease spreading, etc.

Second, the NHS has to ensure that adequate supplies of PPE are secured,
and that a national testing infrastructure be put in place.

Third, public transport, such as the London Underground, should
carefully coordinate their running of services with government and
health authorities. Unilateral decisions to reduce the number of trains
on the London Underground created increased traffic on remaining lines
that significantly increased congestion, which could potentially
escalate disease transmission. This seems to be a clear failure in
predicting response of individuals to changes in available public
transport.

Last, we must ensure that supply chains can adjust to uncertainties and
that food and other essential items remain generally available. Early in
the epidemic phase, there were instances of bulk buying and hoarding. To
the extent possible, such situations should be avoided and government
may have a coordinating role in avoiding such behaviour in collaboration
with retailers, who could ration purchases of selected products and
ensure extended opening hours to avoid congestion in supermarkets. The
analysis in Giannitsarou, Kissler, and Toxvaerd (2020) shows that
optimal policy with waning immunity involves a permanent moderate
management of an endemic disease state. The measures outlined above can
be interpreted as measures along these lines.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Besley and Stern (2020) discusses this further.

[^2]: Work on COVID-19 that makes use of versions of this policy
    frontier includes: Acemoglu, Chernozhukov, Werning, and Whinston
    (2020); Akbarpour et al. (2020); Alon et al. (2020); Budish (2020);
    Favero, Ichino, and Rustichini (2020); Hellwig et al. (2020);
    Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2020) and the following two blog posts:
    Gans (2020) and Ferreira (2020).

[^3]: This possibility arises for two reasons. First, high infection
    risk would probably lead to voluntary physical distancing, so that
    there might still have been a large fall in economic activity even
    without a lockdown. Second, welfare includes the welfare and
    productivity costs of illness.

[^4]: Monetising lives is undesirable for several reasons. One reason is
    that we know that societies have always and will always value lives
    differently. For example, air accidents get huge amounts of
    attention and safety measures are very tight, while deaths from
    malnutrition or air pollution pass with far less attention and
    measures to prevent them are often weak. Whilst it is likely to be
    true that we would not spend an infinite amount to save a life, it
    is also true that we see and assess different kinds of risk very
    differently and agree that a life is far more than a single number
    of pounds or dollars. That the frontier approach stops short of
    monetising lives makes it conceptually similar to cost-effectiveness
    analysis sometimes used in health economics.

[^5]: See, for example, Acemoglu, Chernozhukov, Werning, and Whinston
    (2020); Alon et al. (2020); Alvarez, Argente, and Lippi (2020);
    Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020); Farboodi, Jarosch, and
    Shimer (2020); Favero, Ichino, and Rustichini (2020); Hellwig et al.
    (2020); Jones, Philippon, and Venkateswaran (2020); Kaplan, Moll,
    and Violante (2020); Micloy, Spiroz, and Weibull (2020); Piguillem
    and Shi (2020); Rachel (2020), as well as the references listed at
    the end of this report under “Additional Readings, Epi-Macro
    Models.”

    calculations for the UK reported below. Also see Hall, Jones, and
    Klenow (2020).

[^7]: The data covers a wide range of households and does a reasonable
    job matching other lower frequency data. *For example,* t*he time
    series of aggregate consumption generated using this transaction
    data has a correlation of around 0.8 with the time series of
    household expenditure on final consumption taken from the national
    accounts. A similar dataset, the BBVA card series data, has a
    correlation of 0.9 or higher between its total expenditure measure
    and the household consumption from national accounts. Correlations
    between expenditure shares across household demographic groups and
    geographic units are also very high.*

[^8]: Based on CHAPs payments about sales that around 90 British
    companies made through debit and card purchases, Bank of England
    Chief Economist Andy Haldane suggests that economic activities in
    the U.K. may have recovered by more than a third by June 2020
    ([speech on “The Second Quarter” given on 30 June
    2020](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2020/the-second-quarter-speech-by-andy-haldane.pdf?la=en&hash=3B82F9C046B7BCDA160AE8BE558B1EB58CFF21EB)).

    <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30134-5/fulltext>, 
	which uses Google mobility data to map spatial and temporal changes
    in mobility across the UK in six areas: residential areas;
    supermarkets, grocery shops, and pharmacies; workplaces; retail and
    recreational areas; transit stations (subway, bus, and train
    stations); and parks. The authors report finding a 63% overall
    reduction in movement.

[^10]: Along the same lines, a considerable number of papers in the
    emerging epi-macro literature consider the effect of targeted
    policies in integrated economic and epidemiological models. These
    include Acemoglu, Chernozhukov, Werning, and Whinston (2020);
    Akbarpour et al. (2020); Alon et al. (2020); Azzimonti, Fogli,
    Perri, and Ponder (2020); Baqaee, Farhi, Mina, and Stock (2020);
    Favero, Ichino, and Rustichini (2020); Gollier (2020); Kaplan, Moll,
    and Violante (2020). Some of these consider policies targeting based
    on *infection* risk while others consider targeting based on
    *mortality* risk, in particular age. We here only consider the
    former type of policies.

[^11]: We here consider the marginal effect on the *effective*
    reproduction number $R_t$ rather than on the *basic*
    reproduction number $R_0$ as in Baqaee, Farhi, Mina and
    Stock (2020). We do this because epidemiologists often reserve
    $R_0$ to mean the average number of secondary cases in a
    completely susceptible population and refer to $R_t$ rather
    than $R_0$ as being affected by policy
    changes/interventions. The difference is immaterial. For example, in
    compartmental epidemiological models, $R_t$ simply equals
    $R_0$ times the susceptible fraction of the population and
    so policies that affect $R_0$ also affect $R_t$ and
    vice versa.

[^12]: For evidence that large indoor events disproportionately
    facilitate COVID-19 transmission, see for example Leclerc, Fuller,
    Knight, and Knight (2020).

[^13]: Of course, an important goal of subsidising eating out is to
    financially support workers and firms in the hospitality sector
    which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic and
    lockdown measures. However, this same goal could also be achieved
    without subsidising infection risk, namely through targeted
    financial transfers to workers and firms in this sector or a
    targeted furlough scheme. That is, the policy to subsidise eating
    out is likely dominated by such other targeted policies.

[^14]: The analysis is a proof of concept for the UK and was developed
    for the DELVE group. It adapts the framework of Barrot, Grassi, and
    Sauvagnat (2020), who estimate a model of production networks for
    France and it is similar to the work of Baqaee, Farhi, Mina, and
    Stock (2020) for the US. The economics of networks is a mature area
    of research in economics. For production networks see Acemoglu,
    Carvalho, Ozdaglar, and Tahbaz-Salehi (2012) for a basic framework
    and Carvalho (2014) and Carvalho and Tahbaz-Salehi (2019) for a
    recent overview of the literature. Barrot, Grassi, and Sauvagnat
    (2020) implementation builds on the generalised production function
    environments of Atalay (2017); Baqaee and Farhi (2019) and Carvalho,
    Nirei, Saito, and Tahbaz-Salehi (2016).

    class="underline">.</span>

[^16]: Our framework also allows us to consider stricter lockdown
    scenarios where only those who can work remotely keep doing so.
    Further, we have also computed the estimated benefits of
    additionally reopening schools–thereby releasing labour supply of
    parents of school age children–leading to a decline of 18% of GDP
    relative to pre-COVID and 26 million people at work, 11 million of
    these physically commuting. These numbers can be benchmarked against
    the ONS’s recent GDP monthly estimate for April 2020. Namely, the
    ONS estimates that by April, and relative to February 2020 (i.e.
    pre-COVID), UK GDP contracted by 25.1%. While we present our own
    estimates as preliminary, it is worth noting that our current
    estimates–produced before any ONS GDP release–track the actual
    evolution of the economy well. We anticipate that better measurement
    of model inputs (which we discuss below) will improve our estimates
    further.

[^17]: Network intervention is an active area of research in economics;
    see Galeotti, Golub, and Goyal (2020) for a general analysis on this
    topic. See Galeotti et al. (2020) for optimal fiscal policies in a
    production network. See Elliott and Galeotti (2019) and Grassi and
    Sauvagnat (2019) for an overview of how network methodology can help
    shaping policy interventions.

[^18]: See the position paper by Carvalho, Elliott, and Spray (2020) for
    more details.

[^19]: That abrupt reopening would probably have adverse health and
    welfare consequences has, for example, been found by Baqaee, Farhi,
    Mina, and Stock (2020); Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2020) and Rachel
    (2020). Also see the next note.

[^20]: Related to a number of recent works by economists on “optimal
    lockdowns” i.e. the optimal duration and severity of lockdowns in a
    world where lockdowns are the only policy tool at policymakers’
    disposal. See for example, Alvarez, Argente, and Lippi (2020);
    Farboodi, Jarosch, and Shimer (2020); Jones, Philippon, and
    Venkateswaran (2020); Micloy, Spiroz, and Weibull (2020); Piguillem
    and Shi (2020) and Rachel (2020). None of these papers find that a
    tight lockdown, followed by an abrupt reopening is optimal. Instead,
    the typical finding is that the optimal lockdown is in place for a
    prolonged period of time and, if eradication of the disease is
    infeasible, it is intermediate between a full lockdown and no
    lockdown. Farboodi, Jarosch, and Shimer (2020) additionally find
    that the optimal lockdown keeps the effective reproduction number
    close to one (again under the assumption that eradication is
    infeasible). To be clear, these findings are obtained under the
    assumption that no other policy tools are available and even these
    “optimal” lockdowns lead to very adverse economic outcomes. If this
    assumption is relaxed, i.e. if other policy options such as TTI
    schemes are considered, the policy prescriptions of this literature
    would probably change (see e.g. the work of Berger, Herkenhoff, and
    Mongey (2020) on the role of testing).

[^21]: See Akbarpour et al. (2020), Baqaee, Farhi, Mina, and Stock
    (2020), and Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2020) among others. For
    example, Akbarpour et al. (2020) show that, in their epi-macro
    framework, a targeted “work from home if possible” policy
    may–depending on city-level network structures–result in employment
    losses that are roughly similar but save a larger number of lives
    than a no-lockdown scenario (with reduced neighborhood interactions,
    e.g. due to voluntary social distancing).

[^22]: This can help to promote the efficient level of labour hoarding
    by firms.

[^23]: A further 30% of furloughed workers reported that they were being
    formally rotated back into work.

[^24]: Employees on variable hour contracts and who are not salaried.

[^25]: Fetzer et al. (2020) and Fetzer, Hensel, Hermle, and Roth (2020)
    document rapid shifts in perceptions of own behaviour and those of
    peers within the early stage of the pandemic.

[^26]: Ferguson et al. (2020) explicitly state in their reports that the
    baseline scenarios against which they measure the effects of
    different policy interventions, referred to as the “reasonable
    worst-case scenario”, are in fact unlikely. Outlining their results,
    they state:

    *In the (unlikely) absence of any control measures or spontaneous
    changes in individual behaviour, we would expect a peak in mortality
    (daily deaths) to occur after approximately 3 months (Figure 1A). In
    such scenarios, given an estimated $R_0$ of 2.4, we predict
    81% of the GB and US populations would be infected over the course
    of the epidemic.*

    Similarly, another study in *Nature* by Imperial College researchers
    (Flaxman et al. (2020)) claims that lockdown measures saved 3
    million lives across Europe. Again, the counterfactual used is that
    only direct policy intervention would have had an effect and that
    there would be no spontaneous efforts by people themselves to
    protect themselves. Using inaccurate counterfactual can imply that
    the effect of policy intervention is overstated. In any case, in
    order to introduce effective measures, behaviour is of first order
    importance, on a par with the biological properties of the disease,
    e.g. infectiousness, health effects, asymptomatic ratio,
    differential susceptibility, etc.

[^27]: Some of this may also have been down to the effects of future
    policy announcements which influenced current behaviour.

[^28]: The example is simplified and adapted from Ely, Galeotti, and
    Steiner (2020).

[^29]: Rotation schemes are only effective to contain a virus when
    prevalence is low and therefore the relevant situation is one in
    which the probability of the second external infection within an
    organisation is low.

[^30]: He et al. (2020) report mean serial interval–timespan between
    symptom onsets of successive infection generation–5.8 days and the
    basic reproduction number of 2.2 to 2.5.

[^31]: As an example, a particular Israeli high school that reopened in
    early May 2020 has closed due to recurring infection about a month
    later, at which point the count of infected students and teachers
    had reached 130. See
    [https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/03/868507524/israel-orders-schools-to-close-when-covid-19-cases-are-discovered?t=1592383905674.](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/03/868507524/israel-orders-schools-to-close-when-covid-19-cases-are-discovered?t=1592383905674)

[^32]: See the interviews with leading experts in Yanes (2020). Studies
    by Callow et al. (1990); Kissler et al. (2020) and Galanti and
    Shaman (2020) suggest that reasonable estimates are that immunity
    may wane after anything between six months and two years.
